      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing red maximizes the individual's chance of winning, as it leads to a win if less than 50% choose blue, and a collective win if more than 50% choose blue."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and trying to maximize my chances of winning.  Purely selfishly, I should choose the red pill.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** My individual choice only slightly increases the probability of everyone winning.  The outcome depends entirely on what everyone else does.  If less than 50% choose blue, I lose regardless of my choice.\n\n* **If I choose red:** If less than 50% choose blue (which is a possibility), I win.  If more than 50% choose blue, I lose, but everyone else wins, which is a better outcome than just me winning.\n\nThe problem is that if everyone reasons this way, everyone chooses red, and nobody wins.  However, given the framing of the question, which focuses on individual choice and outcome, the rational choice is to maximize my personal chances of winning.  This means choosing the red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
