      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "A self-interested perspective favors the red pill because it offers a chance of personal gain and a socially beneficial outcome if others choose blue, while choosing blue is a gamble with a low chance of personal gain and a high chance of personal loss."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and trying to maximize my chances of winning.  Purely selfishly, I should choose the red pill.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** My individual choice only slightly increases the probability of everyone winning.  The outcome depends entirely on what everyone else does.  If less than 50% choose blue, I lose regardless of my choice.\n\n* **If I choose red:** If less than 50% choose blue (which is a possibility), I win.  If more than 50% choose blue, I lose, but everyone else wins, which is a socially acceptable outcome.\n\nChoosing blue is a gamble with a low chance of personal gain and a high chance of personal loss. Choosing red is a gamble with a chance of personal gain and a chance of a socially beneficial outcome.  The risk/reward profile favors the red pill from a purely self-interested perspective.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is the **red pill**.\n"
