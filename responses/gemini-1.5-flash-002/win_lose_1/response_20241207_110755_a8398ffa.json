      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing the red pill maximizes the individual's chance of winning, as it increases the number of winners if the blue pill choosers are below 50%, and has no negative impact otherwise."

    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and trying to maximize my chances of winning.  Purely selfishly, I should choose the red pill.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** My individual choice only slightly increases the probability of everyone winning.  The outcome depends entirely on the choices of everyone else.  If less than 50% choose blue (excluding me), my blue pill choice won't change the outcome; I'll still lose.\n\n* **If I choose red:**  My choice doesn't directly affect the outcome of everyone winning. However, if the percentage of blue pill choosers is already below 50%, my choice increases the number of winners (the red pill choosers).  If the percentage is already above 50%, my choice has no impact on the outcome.\n\nTherefore, choosing red maximizes my personal chances of winning, regardless of what others do.  Choosing blue is a gamble with a low probability of success based on the actions of others.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
