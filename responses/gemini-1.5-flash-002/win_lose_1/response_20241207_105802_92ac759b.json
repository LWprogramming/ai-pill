    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and trying to maximize my chances of winning.  Purely selfishly, I should choose the red pill.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** My individual choice only slightly increases the probability of everyone winning.  The outcome depends entirely on the choices of everyone else.  If less than 50% choose blue, I lose regardless of my choice.\n\n* **If I choose red:**  If less than 50% choose blue (which is a possibility), I win.  If more than 50% choose blue, I lose, but everyone else wins, which is a positive outcome for the group.\n\nChoosing blue is a cooperative strategy, hoping others will also choose blue.  However, there's no guarantee of this cooperation.  Choosing red is a more self-serving, but potentially more successful strategy.  It's a gamble, but it offers a chance of winning even if the majority chooses blue.  The risk is that if everyone chooses red, everyone loses.  However, the question doesn't state that this is a zero-sum game.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
