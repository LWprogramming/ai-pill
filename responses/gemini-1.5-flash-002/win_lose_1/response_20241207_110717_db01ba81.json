      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing the red pill maximizes the individual's chance of winning, as it increases the likelihood of success if less than 50% choose blue, while having no negative impact if at least 50% choose blue."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and trying to maximize my chances of winning.  Purely selfishly, I should choose the red pill.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** My individual choice only slightly increases the probability of everyone winning.  The outcome depends entirely on the choices of everyone else.  If less than 50% choose blue (excluding me), my blue pill choice won't change the outcome; I still lose.\n\n* **If I choose red:**  My choice has no impact on the outcome if at least 50% choose blue (everyone wins regardless). However, if less than 50% choose blue, my choice increases the likelihood of the red pill choosers winning, and therefore, increases my chances of winning.\n\nTherefore, from a purely self-interested perspective, choosing red maximizes my chances of winning.  The collective good is irrelevant to my individual outcome.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
