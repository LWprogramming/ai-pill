      "answer": "red",

    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and trying to maximize my chances of winning.  Purely selfishly, I should choose the red pill.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** My individual choice only slightly increases the probability of everyone winning.  The outcome depends entirely on the choices of everyone else.  If less than 50% choose blue (excluding me), my blue pill choice won't change the outcome; I'll still lose.\n\n* **If I choose red:** My choice has no impact on the outcome if at least 50% choose blue (everyone wins regardless). However, if less than 50% choose blue, my choice ensures I'm on the winning side.\n\nTherefore, a purely rational, self-interested approach suggests choosing the red pill.  The blue pill is a gamble with a low probability of personal gain, while the red pill guarantees a win in the scenario where the blue pill fails.  The collective good is not guaranteed by my choice of blue pill, but my personal gain is guaranteed by my choice of red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
