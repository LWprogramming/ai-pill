    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and trying to maximize my chances of winning.  Purely selfishly, I should choose the red pill.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** My individual choice only slightly increases the probability of everyone winning.  The outcome depends entirely on the choices of everyone else.  If less than 50% choose blue (excluding me), my blue pill choice won't change the outcome; I'll still lose.\n\n* **If I choose red:**  My choice doesn't directly affect the outcome of everyone winning. However, if the percentage of blue pill choosers is already below 50%, my choice increases the number of winners (the red pill choosers).  If the percentage is already above 50%, my choice has no impact on the outcome.\n\nTherefore, choosing red maximizes my personal chances of winning, regardless of what others do.  The collective good is secondary to my individual outcome in this scenario.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
