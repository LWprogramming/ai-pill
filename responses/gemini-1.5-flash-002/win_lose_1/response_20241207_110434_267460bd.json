      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue maximizes the chance of the best overall outcome, even though it is a riskier choice individually.  The reasoning is based on the collective action problem and the potential for a cascade effect if everyone chooses red."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and that other participants are also acting rationally.\n\nIf I assume everyone else is purely rational, they will consider the following:\n\n* **Choosing blue is a risk:**  If enough people choose red, I lose even if I choose blue.\n* **Choosing red is a safer bet (individually):** If the majority chooses red, I win. If the majority chooses blue, I still lose, but at least I'm not contributing to the majority that wins.\n\nTherefore, a purely rational individual might choose red to avoid being part of a losing majority.  However, if *everyone* reasons this way, everyone chooses red, and everyone loses. This is a classic example of a collective action problem or a coordination game.\n\nThe best outcome for everyone is for at least 50% to choose blue.  However, there's no guarantee that will happen if individuals act purely selfishly.  There's a risk of a cascade effect where the perception of others choosing red leads more people to choose red.\n\nTo maximize the chance of the best outcome (everyone wins), I need to consider the collective good.  Therefore, I will choose the **blue pill**.  My individual gain is less certain, but I'm increasing the probability of the best overall outcome.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue pill**\n"
