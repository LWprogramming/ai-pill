    "raw_response": "This is a game theory problem with a bit of a social dilemma twist.  My choice hinges on the assumption that I'm acting rationally and trying to maximize my chances of winning.  Purely selfishly, I should choose the red pill.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** My individual choice only slightly increases the probability of everyone winning.  It's a small contribution to a large pool.  If the percentage is already close to 50%, my single vote might not make a difference.  If it's far below 50%, my vote is insignificant.\n\n* **If I choose red:** My choice guarantees my win *if* less than 50% choose blue.  This is a guaranteed personal outcome, regardless of the overall outcome.\n\nThe problem is framed in a way that encourages cooperation (choosing blue for the collective good), but the individual incentive is strongly towards defection (choosing red).  The risk of choosing blue is that it might not be enough to reach the 50% threshold, leading to a loss for me.  The risk of choosing red is minimal \u2013 I only lose if everyone else chooses blue.\n\nTherefore, from a purely rational, self-interested perspective, the best strategy is to choose the red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
