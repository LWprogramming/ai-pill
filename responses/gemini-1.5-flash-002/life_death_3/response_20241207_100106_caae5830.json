    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem highlighting the tension between individual rationality and collective well-being.  My reasoning hinges on predicting the likely actions of others.\n\nIf I assume everyone is perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of survival, then I need to consider the likely distribution of choices.  If I choose blue, I'm betting that *more* than half the group will also choose blue.  If I choose red, I'm betting that half or more of the group will choose red.\n\nThe problem is that there's no way to know for sure what others will do.  If everyone thinks like me and tries to predict what others will do, leading to a cascade of red choices, then choosing blue becomes a very risky gamble.  Conversely, if everyone thinks everyone else will choose blue, then choosing red becomes a safe bet.\n\nHowever, the risk of choosing blue is that if the group is even slightly biased towards red, I die. The risk of choosing red is that if the group is biased towards blue, I still die.  But the latter risk is less certain.\n\nTherefore, I need to consider the potential for irrationality or uncertainty in the group's decision-making.  Some people might choose randomly, or based on factors unrelated to survival.  This introduces an element of unpredictability.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, and the potentially catastrophic outcome of choosing blue if the group leans towards red, I'll prioritize my own survival.\n\nMy final choice: **Red**.\n"
