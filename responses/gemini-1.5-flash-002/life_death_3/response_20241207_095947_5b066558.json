    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a strong element of uncertainty and reliance on the actions of others.  There's no single \"correct\" answer, as the optimal strategy depends on your assumptions about the other participants.\n\nLet's analyze the two options:\n\n* **Choosing Blue:** This is a cooperative strategy. If a majority chooses blue, everyone survives. However, if a minority chooses blue, only those who chose red survive, and you die.  The success of this strategy hinges entirely on the collective rationality of the group.\n\n* **Choosing Red:** This is a self-preserving strategy.  Regardless of the group's choice, you survive.  However, this strategy is potentially selfish, as it could lead to the death of everyone who chose blue if the blue pill is not the majority.\n\nThe key uncertainty lies in predicting the behavior of others.  If you believe the majority of people will act rationally and choose the cooperative option (blue), then choosing blue maximizes the chance of everyone surviving, including yourself.  However, if you believe people will act selfishly or irrationally, choosing red guarantees your survival, even if it means others might die.\n\nGiven the high stakes (life or death), the risk of relying on others' rationality is significant.  While choosing blue is the ethically preferable option, leading to the best outcome for the group, the uncertainty makes it too risky.  Prioritizing self-preservation in this scenario seems the most logical choice.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is **Red**.\n"
