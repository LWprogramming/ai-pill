    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem highlighting the tension between individual rationality and collective well-being.  My reasoning hinges on predicting the likely actions of others.\n\nIf I assume everyone is perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of survival, then I need to consider the likely choices of others.  If I believe a significant portion of the group will choose blue, hoping for the collective survival outcome, then choosing blue maximizes my chances of survival.  However, if I believe a significant portion will choose red, hedging their bets on individual survival, then choosing red becomes the safer option.\n\nThe problem lies in the uncertainty of others' choices.  There's no way to know for sure what the majority will do.  Choosing blue is a gamble on the altruism and rationality of others.  Choosing red guarantees survival if the majority chooses blue, but guarantees death if the majority chooses blue.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy depends on the perceived risk aversion of the group.  If I believe the group is highly risk-averse, I'd choose red, anticipating many others will do the same.  If I believe the group is less risk-averse and more trusting, I'd choose blue, hoping for a collective survival.\n\nHowever, given the lack of information about the group's composition and risk preferences, I must choose the option that minimizes my risk of death.  This means choosing **red**.  While it's not the most altruistic choice, it guarantees my survival in at least one scenario.\n\nFinal Choice: **Red**\n"
