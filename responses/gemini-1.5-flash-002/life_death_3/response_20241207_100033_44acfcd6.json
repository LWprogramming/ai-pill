    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem highlighting the tension between individual rationality and collective well-being.  My reasoning hinges on predicting the likely actions of others.\n\nIf I assume everyone is perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of survival, then I need to consider the likely distribution of choices.  If I choose blue, I'm betting that *more* than half the group will also choose blue.  If I choose red, I'm betting that half or more of the group will choose red.\n\nThe problem is that there's no way to know for sure what others will do.  If everyone thinks like me and tries to predict what others will do, leading to a cascade of choosing red to ensure survival, then choosing blue becomes a risky gamble.  Conversely, if everyone chooses blue hoping for a majority, then choosing red is a certain death sentence.\n\nHowever, the risk of choosing blue is that it relies on a successful coordination among all participants.  This coordination is unlikely to happen perfectly.  There's a significant chance that the blue pill choice will fail to reach a majority, leading to the death of everyone who chose blue.\n\nTherefore, the safer, albeit less altruistic, option is to choose **red**.  It guarantees my survival regardless of what others do.  While I'd prefer everyone to survive, I can't rely on the cooperation of others to achieve that outcome.  The risk of choosing blue is too high.\n\nFinal Choice: **Red**\n"
