    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem highlighting the tension between individual rationality and collective well-being.  My reasoning hinges on predicting the likely actions of others.\n\nIf I assume everyone is perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of survival, then I need to consider the likely distribution of choices.  If I choose blue, I'm betting that *more* than half the group will also choose blue.  If I choose red, I'm betting that half or more of the group will choose red.\n\nThe problem is that there's no way to know for sure what others will do.  If everyone thinks like me and tries to predict what others will do, leading to a cascade of choosing red to ensure survival, then choosing blue becomes a risky gamble.  Conversely, if everyone chooses blue hoping for a majority, then choosing red guarantees survival.\n\nHowever, the risk of choosing blue is that it relies on a high degree of cooperation and accurate prediction of others' behavior.  The risk of choosing red is that it could lead to a smaller surviving group if many others also choose red.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the potential for a cascade effect towards red, I believe the safest strategy is to choose **red**.  This guarantees my survival regardless of what others do, whereas choosing blue relies on a successful coordination that is unlikely to occur in a scenario where everyone is acting independently to maximize their own survival.\n\nFinal Choice: **Red**\n"
