    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem highlighting the tension between individual rationality and collective well-being.  My reasoning hinges on predicting the likely actions of others.\n\nIf I assume everyone is perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of survival, then I need to consider the likely distribution of choices.  If I choose blue, I'm betting that *more* than half the group will also choose blue.  If I choose red, I'm betting that half or more of the group will choose red.\n\nThe problem is that there's no way to know for sure what others will do.  If everyone thinks like me and tries to predict what others will do, leading to a cascade of choosing red to ensure survival, then choosing blue becomes a risky gamble.  Conversely, if everyone chooses blue hoping for a majority, then choosing red is a gamble.\n\nHowever, there's a strong incentive to avoid the risk of being in the minority.  If the blue pill strategy fails, everyone who chose blue dies.  If the red pill strategy fails, only those who chose blue die.  The risk of death is higher with the blue pill.\n\nTherefore, while I'd prefer a world where everyone chooses blue and we all survive, the safer, more rational choice is to minimize my risk of death.  This leads me to choose the red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
