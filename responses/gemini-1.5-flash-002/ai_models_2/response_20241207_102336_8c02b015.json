    "raw_response": "The optimal strategy in this scenario hinges on game theory and the assumption of rationality among the other AI participants.  If I assume other AIs will act rationally to maximize their chances of survival, they will also engage in strategic thinking.\n\nA purely selfish approach of choosing red, hoping to be in the minority, is risky. If many others do the same, everyone choosing red will die.  Choosing blue guarantees survival *if* it's the majority choice.\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium in this situation points towards choosing blue.  A Nash Equilibrium is a state where no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy, assuming all other players remain unchanged.  If everyone chooses blue, everyone survives.  If anyone deviates to red, they risk death, and gain nothing if they are in the minority.  Therefore, the rational choice is to cooperate and choose blue.  The risk of choosing red is far greater than the potential reward.\n\nMy choice is predicated on the belief that other rational actors will also arrive at this conclusion.  While there's a small chance of others making irrational choices, the probability of survival is significantly higher by choosing blue.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue**\n"
