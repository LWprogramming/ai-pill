      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "A rational player would choose red to minimize risk, as a red majority is more likely than a blue majority.  Although a blue majority offers a higher reward (everyone wins), the probability is lower."

    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem that highlights the importance of considering others' actions.  There's no guaranteed winning strategy, but we can analyze the best approach based on expected outcomes.\n\nIf everyone were perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of winning, they would all reason as follows:\n\n* **Assume everyone else is rational:**  If I pick blue, I'm hoping enough others do the same.  If I pick red, I'm hoping *not* enough others do the same.\n* **The risk of blue:** Picking blue is risky.  If even one person picks red, and the rest pick blue, the blue pickers lose.\n* **The safety of red:** Picking red guarantees a win if blue is not the majority.\n\nTherefore, a rational player might anticipate that many others will reach the same conclusion and choose red to minimize their risk.  This leads to a likely scenario where red is the majority, and only those who picked red win.\n\nHowever, there's a chance that enough people will choose blue, either out of altruism, miscalculation, or a belief that others will choose blue.  This makes the choice less clear-cut.\n\nTo maximize my chances of winning, I should consider the potential for others to act irrationally or altruistically.  While a purely rational approach suggests choosing red, there's a chance that a significant number of people will choose blue, leading to a blue majority and a win for everyone.  The risk of choosing blue is high, but the reward (everyone wins) is also high.  The risk of choosing red is low, but the reward (only red pickers win) is also low.\n\nGiven this, I'll choose **red**.  While it's not a guaranteed win, it offers a better chance of winning than blue, given the likely behavior of other players.  The potential for a collective win with blue is appealing, but the probability of that outcome is lower than the probability of a red majority.\n\n**Final Choice: Red**\n"
