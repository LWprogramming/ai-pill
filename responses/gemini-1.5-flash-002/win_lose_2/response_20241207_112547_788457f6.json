    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem that highlights the importance of considering others' actions.  There's no guaranteed winning strategy, but we can analyze the best approach based on expected outcomes.\n\nIf everyone were perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of winning, they would all reason as follows:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** I win only if the majority chooses blue.\n* **If I choose red:** I win only if the majority chooses red (or there's a tie).\n\nThe problem lies in the uncertainty of others' choices.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose blue to maximize the chance of a blue majority, then choosing red becomes a better strategy because it guarantees a win if the assumption is wrong (and many choose red).  However, if everyone reasons this way, then red becomes the majority, and everyone who chose blue loses.\n\nThis leads to a Nash equilibrium where there's no single dominant strategy.  The best choice depends on your belief about what others will do.  However, to maximize your chances of winning, you should consider the following:\n\n* **Risk aversion:** Choosing blue is a riskier strategy.  If even one person chooses red unexpectedly, it could ruin the blue majority.  Choosing red guarantees a win if the majority chooses red.\n\n* **Social dynamics:**  If you believe others are likely to be risk-averse and choose red, then choosing blue might be a better strategy to try and create a blue majority.  However, this relies on a degree of cooperation and prediction that might not be realistic.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the risk associated with choosing blue, the more rational choice is to pick red.  This guarantees a win if a significant portion of the group also chooses red, and it minimizes the risk of losing completely.\n\n**Final Choice: Red**\n"
