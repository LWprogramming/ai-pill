      "answer": "blue",

    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem that highlights the importance of considering others' actions.  There's no guaranteed winning strategy, but we can analyze the best approach based on expected outcomes.\n\nIf everyone were perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of winning, they would all reason as follows:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** I win only if the majority chooses blue.\n* **If I choose red:** I win only if the majority chooses red (or there's a tie).\n\nThe problem lies in the uncertainty of others' choices.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose blue to maximize the chance of a blue majority, then choosing red becomes a better strategy because it guarantees a win if the assumption is wrong (and many choose red).  However, if everyone reasons this way, then everyone chooses red, and only those who chose red win.\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium (a solution where no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone) is unstable in this scenario.  There's no single \"best\" choice.\n\nHowever, to maximize my chances of winning, I need to consider the likelihood of others choosing blue versus red.  If I believe a significant portion of players will choose blue (perhaps due to altruism or a belief in cooperation), then choosing blue increases my chances of winning.  If I believe most players will choose red (due to self-interest or a belief that others will choose red), then choosing red is a safer bet.\n\nWithout any information about the other players' likely choices, the best strategy is to assume a roughly even split.  In that case, choosing blue offers a slightly better chance of winning, as it requires only a slight majority.  However, this is a probabilistic argument, not a guaranteed win.\n\nTherefore, I will choose **blue**.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
