    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a bit of a twist.  The standard Nash equilibrium strategy doesn't directly apply because the outcome isn't solely determined by my individual choice, but by the collective choices of everyone.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **I choose blue:**  If enough others choose blue to make it the majority, everyone wins, including me.  However, if not enough others choose blue, only those who chose red win, and I lose.\n\n* **I choose red:** If blue is the majority, I lose.  If red is the majority (or even a tie), I win.\n\nThe key is to think about what others are likely to do.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose randomly, there's a roughly 50/50 chance of blue being the majority.  However, if everyone starts thinking strategically, they might realize that choosing red guarantees a win *if* red is the majority. This could lead to a cascade effect where more and more people choose red, ultimately leading to a situation where only those who chose red win.\n\nTherefore, to maximize my chances of winning, I should consider the potential for this cascade effect.  Choosing blue relies on a significant number of others also choosing blue, which is less certain than the possibility of a red majority driven by strategic thinking.\n\nMy choice is to pick **blue**.  While it's riskier, it offers the potential for a collective win, and the potential for a red majority is driven by a cascade of strategic thinking that might not always occur.  The potential reward of everyone winning outweighs the risk of losing if the red majority scenario plays out.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
