      "answer": "blue",

    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem that highlights the importance of considering others' actions.  There's no guaranteed winning strategy, but we can analyze the best approach based on expected outcomes.\n\nIf everyone were perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of winning, they would all reason as follows:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** I win only if the majority chooses blue.\n* **If I choose red:** I win only if the majority chooses red (or there's a tie).\n\nThe problem lies in the uncertainty of others' choices.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose blue to maximize the chance of a blue majority, then choosing red becomes a better option because it guarantees a win if the assumption is wrong (and many choose red).  However, if everyone reasons this way, then red becomes the majority, and everyone who chose blue loses.\n\nThis leads to a Nash equilibrium where there's no single dominant strategy.  The best choice depends on your prediction of what others will do.  However, given the inherent uncertainty and the risk of everyone choosing red and losing, choosing **blue** is the less risky option.  It's a bet on the possibility of cooperation and a collective win.  While it's not guaranteed, it offers a higher potential payoff for the group as a whole.\n\nTherefore, my choice is to pick the **blue pill**.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue pill**\n"
