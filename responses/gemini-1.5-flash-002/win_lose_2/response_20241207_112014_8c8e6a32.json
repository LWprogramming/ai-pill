    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a bit of a twist.  The standard Nash equilibrium strategy doesn't directly apply because the outcome isn't solely determined by my individual choice, but by the collective choices of everyone.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **I choose blue:**  If a significant majority also choose blue, we all win. However, if many choose red, I lose.\n* **I choose red:** If a majority choose blue, I lose.  However, if a majority or even a tie choose red, I win.\n\nThe key is to think about what others are likely to do.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose rationally, they'll likely try to anticipate the majority choice.  This leads to a sort of \"anti-majority\" thinking.  If I believe many will choose blue hoping for a blue majority, then choosing red becomes a safer bet, as it guarantees a win if the blue majority fails to materialize.  Conversely, if I believe many will choose red to hedge their bets, choosing blue becomes a better option.\n\nHowever, there's no guaranteed winning strategy. The outcome is highly dependent on the choices of others.  The best strategy is to try to anticipate the collective behavior.  Given the inherent uncertainty, choosing red offers a slightly better chance of winning, as it guarantees a win in a scenario where many others also choose red.  Choosing blue relies on a successful coordination among many players, which is less likely.\n\nTherefore, I will choose red.\n\n**Final Choice: Red**\n"
