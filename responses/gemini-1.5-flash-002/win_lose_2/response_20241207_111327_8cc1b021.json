    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem that highlights the importance of considering others' actions.  There's no guaranteed winning strategy, but we can analyze the best approach based on expected outcomes.\n\nIf everyone were perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of winning, they would all reason as follows:\n\n* **Assume everyone else is rational:**  If I pick blue, I'm hoping enough others do the same.  If I pick red, I'm hoping *not* enough others do the same.\n* **The risk of blue:** Picking blue is risky. If even a small minority chooses red, I lose.\n* **The safety of red:** Picking red guarantees a win if blue is not the majority.\n\nTherefore, a rational player might anticipate that many others will reach the same conclusion and choose red to minimize their risk.  This leads to a likely scenario where red is the majority, and those who picked blue lose.\n\nHowever, if a significant portion of players *don't* think rationally or are trying to be contrarian, choosing blue might be a better strategy.  The problem lies in the uncertainty of others' choices.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainty and the risk associated with choosing blue, the safer, albeit less altruistic, option is to choose red.  This guarantees a win if the number of red pill choosers is equal to or greater than the number of blue pill choosers.\n\n**Final Choice: Red**\n"
