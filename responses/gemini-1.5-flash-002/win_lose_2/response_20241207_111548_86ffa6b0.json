    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a bit of a twist.  The standard Nash equilibrium approach doesn't directly apply because the payoff isn't solely determined by your individual choice, but by the collective choices.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **If I choose blue:** I win if blue is the majority.  I lose if red is the majority.\n* **If I choose red:** I win if red is the majority. I lose if blue is the majority.\n\nThe key is to think about what others are likely to do.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose randomly, there's a roughly 50/50 chance of either color being the majority.  However, if a significant portion of players reason like this and choose blue hoping for a majority, then choosing blue becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The more people who choose blue based on this reasoning, the more likely it is that blue will be the majority, leading to everyone winning.\n\nConversely, if everyone chooses red, only those who chose red win.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to anticipate this collective reasoning and choose **blue**.  The risk of choosing red is that if even a small number of people choose blue based on this logic, the red choosers lose.  Choosing blue maximizes the chances of everyone winning, including yourself.\n\n**My final choice is blue.**\n"
