    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a bit of a twist.  The standard Nash equilibrium strategy doesn't directly apply because the outcome isn't solely determined by my individual choice, but by the collective choices of everyone.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **I choose blue:**  If a significant majority also choose blue, we all win. However, if many choose red, I lose.\n* **I choose red:** If a majority choose blue, I lose.  However, if a majority or even a tie choose red, I win.\n\nThe key is to think about what others are likely to do.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose blue to maximize the chance of a collective win, then choosing red becomes a surprisingly good strategy.  This is because it exploits the possibility that others might not be perfectly rational or might be swayed by the same logic.  If a significant portion of players think like this and choose red, then choosing red becomes the winning strategy.\n\nHowever, there's a risk. If almost everyone chooses blue, hoping for the collective win, then choosing red is a guaranteed loss.  It's a gamble.\n\nThe best strategy depends on the number of players and the expected rationality of those players.  With a large number of players, the probability of a blue majority is higher, making blue seem safer.  However, the potential for others to reason similarly and choose red makes red a viable, albeit riskier, option.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the potential for others to reason similarly, I'll choose **red**.  The potential reward of winning even if the majority chooses red outweighs the risk of losing if a blue majority occurs, especially if I believe a significant portion of other players will also choose red based on similar reasoning.\n\n**Final Choice: Red**\n"
