      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing red maximizes the chances of winning because it guarantees a win if there is no blue majority, while choosing blue is riskier and depends on others' choices."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem that highlights the importance of considering others' actions.  There's no guaranteed winning strategy, but we can analyze the best approach based on expected outcomes.\n\nIf everyone were perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of winning, they would all reason as follows:\n\n* **Assume everyone else is rational:**  If I pick blue, I'm hoping enough others do the same to create a blue majority.  But if everyone else is also thinking rationally, they'll be considering the same thing.\n* **The risk of blue:** Picking blue is a risky strategy. If even a small number of people choose red, the blue majority is lost, and I lose.\n* **The safety of red:** Picking red guarantees a win if there's no blue majority.\n\nTherefore, the Nash Equilibrium (a stable state where no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone) points towards everyone choosing red.  If everyone chooses red, those who chose red win. If even one person chooses blue, hoping for a blue majority, and everyone else chooses red, that person loses.\n\nWhile there's a slim chance that a large enough group might coincidentally choose blue, the safest and most rational choice is to maximize your chances of winning by selecting red.\n\n**My final choice is red.**\n"
