    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem that highlights the importance of considering others' actions.  There's no guaranteed winning strategy, but we can analyze the best approach based on expected outcomes.\n\nIf everyone were perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of winning, they would all reason as follows:\n\n* **Assume everyone else is rational:**  If I pick blue, I'm hoping enough others do the same to create a blue majority.  But if everyone else is also thinking this way, they'll also pick blue, leading to a blue majority and everyone winning.\n* **The risk of red:** If I pick red, I'm betting that a significant portion of others will choose blue.  However, if many others also choose red, hoping for a red win, then only the red-pill choosers win, and I'm relying on a significant number of people making a less optimal choice.\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium (a stable state where no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone) in this scenario points towards choosing **blue**.  While there's a risk that not enough people will choose blue, the potential reward (everyone wins) is significantly higher than the reward of choosing red (only red-pill choosers win).  Choosing red relies on others making a less optimal choice.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to assume rationality in others and choose the option that leads to the best outcome *if* everyone makes the same rational choice.\n\nMy final choice: **Blue**.\n"
