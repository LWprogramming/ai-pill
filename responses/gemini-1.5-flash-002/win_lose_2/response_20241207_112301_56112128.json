    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a bit of a twist.  The standard Nash equilibrium strategy doesn't directly apply because the outcome isn't solely determined by my individual choice, but by the collective choices of everyone.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **I choose blue:**  If a significant majority also choose blue, we all win. However, if many choose red, I lose.\n* **I choose red:** If a majority choose blue, I lose.  However, if a majority or even a tie choose red, I win.\n\nThe key is to think about what others are likely to do.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose blue to maximize the chance of a collective win, then choosing red becomes a better strategy because it guarantees a win in the scenario where many others also choose red (which is likely if everyone is thinking this way).  However, if everyone thinks this way, then choosing blue becomes the better strategy again.  It's a self-defeating cycle.\n\nThere's no guaranteed winning strategy.  However, to avoid being in the losing minority, choosing **red** mitigates the risk of being on the losing side if the majority chooses blue.  While it doesn't guarantee a win, it offers a better chance of winning than choosing blue if a significant portion of the players choose red based on similar reasoning.\n\nMy final choice is **red**.\n"
