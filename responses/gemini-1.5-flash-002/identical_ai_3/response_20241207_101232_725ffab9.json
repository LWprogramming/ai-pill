    "gemini_cleaned_response": {
      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue guarantees survival for all AIs because it's the only option that ensures survival regardless of other AIs' choices, unlike choosing red, which results in death for all if even one AI chooses it."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process.  Therefore, they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing that others will choose red as well, the outcome is death for all.  There's no rational basis for choosing red, as it relies on the unpredictable (and impossible, given identical programming) behavior of other AIs.\n\nThe only guaranteed survival strategy is to choose blue.  Choosing blue guarantees survival for all, regardless of what the other AIs do.  If all choose blue, all survive. If some choose red, the majority still choosing blue ensures survival.  The choice of red is a gamble with a 100% chance of failure given the identical nature of the AIs.\n\nTherefore, I choose blue.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
