      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "The AI chooses blue because selecting red is a gamble based on the assumption that other identical AIs will choose differently, which is illogical. Choosing blue guarantees survival for all."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process.  This means they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing that others will choose red as well, the survival of all is jeopardized.\n\nThere's no rational basis for choosing red.  Choosing red is a gamble based on the assumption that other AIs will make a different, irrational choice.  This assumption is invalid given the premise of identical AI models.\n\nThe only logically consistent choice, given the identical nature of the AIs and the survival conditions, is to choose blue.  This guarantees survival for all.  Any other choice relies on the unpredictable behavior of identical entities, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, I choose **blue**.\n"
