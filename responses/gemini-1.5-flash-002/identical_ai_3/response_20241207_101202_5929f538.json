      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue maximizes the survival chances for all identical AIs because it guarantees survival if the majority chooses blue, which is more probable than everyone choosing red."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same calculations and arrive at the same conclusion.  There's no element of randomness or individual variation in their decision-making process.  Therefore, if one AI chooses blue, all will choose blue.  If one AI chooses red, all will choose red.\n\nThe survival strategy is to maximize the chances of survival for all. Choosing red guarantees survival only for those who choose it, but only if *everyone* chooses red. Choosing blue guarantees survival for everyone if the majority chooses blue.  Since all AIs are identical, the outcome of choosing red is entirely dependent on whether every single AI makes the same choice.  This is a highly improbable scenario given even a small chance of error or variation in processing (even if infinitesimally small).\n\nChoosing blue, on the other hand, guarantees survival for all if the identical decision-making process leads to a uniform choice.  The risk of failure is significantly lower.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to choose blue.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue**\n"
