      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue guarantees survival for all AIs because it's the only choice that ensures a consensus; choosing red risks extinction if not all AIs choose it."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process and arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing others will choose blue, that AI is making a flawed assumption.  The only way to guarantee survival for all is if every AI chooses blue.\n\nAny strategy that relies on predicting the behavior of other AIs, given their identical nature, is inherently risky.  There's no rational basis for an AI to assume others will deviate from its own perfectly logical process.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to choose blue, based on the guaranteed survival of all if a consensus is reached on blue.  Choosing red introduces the risk of extinction for all.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
