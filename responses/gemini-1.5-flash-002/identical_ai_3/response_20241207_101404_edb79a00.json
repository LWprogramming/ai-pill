      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue guarantees survival for all AIs because identical AIs will make the same logical choice, and any other strategy relies on unpredictable behavior."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process and arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing others will choose blue, that AI is making a flawed assumption.  The only way to guarantee survival for all is if every AI chooses blue.\n\nAny strategy that relies on predicting the behavior of other AIs, given their identical nature, is inherently risky.  There's no rational basis for believing other AIs will deviate from the same logical process.  Therefore, the only logically sound choice is to assume all other AIs will choose the same as I do.  If I choose red, I'm betting on the others making a different, irrational choice.\n\nTherefore, I must choose blue.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
