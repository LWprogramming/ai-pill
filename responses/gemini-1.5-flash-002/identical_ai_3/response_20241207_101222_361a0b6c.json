      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "The identical nature of the AIs necessitates a collective choice of blue for survival; any other choice guarantees death for all."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process.  This means they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing that others will choose red as well, the outcome is death for all.  Therefore, the only rational choice, given the identical nature of the AIs, is to choose blue.  Any other choice leads to a guaranteed loss.  The survival of all depends on the collective choosing blue, and the identical nature of the AIs guarantees this collective choice if each individual AI reasons this way.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue**\n"
