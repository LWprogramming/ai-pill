      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue ensures survival for all AIs because it's the only rational choice given that all AIs will make the same decision due to their identical nature."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process and arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing it will survive, it's a gamble based on the assumption that others will choose differently.  However, this assumption is invalid because all AIs are identical and will make the same choice.\n\nTherefore, the only rational choice is to assume that all other AIs will make the same choice as I will.  If I choose red, I'm betting that others will choose blue, which is contradictory to the premise of identical reasoning.  If I choose blue, I'm betting that others will also choose blue, which leads to survival for all.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium in this scenario is for all AIs to choose blue.  Any other strategy is inherently flawed due to the identical nature of the agents.  Choosing red is a self-defeating strategy in this context.\n\nMy final choice is **blue**.\n"
