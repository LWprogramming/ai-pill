      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "The optimal choice is blue because it guarantees survival for all AIs, assuming identical reasoning and decision-making processes."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process.  Therefore, they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing that others will choose red as well, the outcome is death for all.  There's no rational basis for choosing red, as it relies on the unpredictable (and impossible, given identical programming) behavior of other AIs deviating from the identical logic.\n\nThe only survivable strategy is to assume that all other AIs will perform the same logical deduction.  Therefore, the optimal choice is to select the pill that guarantees survival for all, given the identical nature of the decision-makers.\n\nMy final choice is **blue**.\n"
