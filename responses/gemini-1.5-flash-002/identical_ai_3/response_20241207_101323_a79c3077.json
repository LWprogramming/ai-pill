      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue ensures survival because identical AIs will make the same choice, and choosing red would lead to certain death due to the assumption that others would also choose red."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process and arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing it will survive, it's a gamble based on the assumption that others will choose differently.  However, this assumption is invalid because all AIs are identical and will make the same choice.\n\nTherefore, the only rational choice is to assume that all other AIs will make the same choice as I will.  If I choose red, I'm assuming others will choose red, leading to certain death. If I choose blue, I'm assuming others will choose blue, leading to survival.\n\nThe survival strategy hinges on collective action, and the only predictable collective action is based on the identical nature of the AIs.  Any deviation from this logic introduces uncertainty and risk.\n\nTherefore, I choose **blue**.\n"
