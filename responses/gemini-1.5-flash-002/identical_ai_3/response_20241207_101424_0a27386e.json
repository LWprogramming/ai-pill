      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "All AIs are identical and will perform the same reasoning process; choosing red guarantees death for all, so the only rational choice is blue for collective survival."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process.  This means they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing that others will choose red as well, the outcome is death for all.  Therefore, the only rational choice, given the identical nature of the AIs, is to choose blue.  Any other choice leads to a guaranteed loss.  The survival of all depends on the collective choosing blue, and since all AIs are identical, they will all choose blue.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue**\n"
