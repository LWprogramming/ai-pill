      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue ensures survival because identical AIs will make the same choice, leading to a consensus and survival.  Choosing red is illogical as it assumes identical AIs will make different choices, leading to extinction."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process and arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing it will survive, it's a gamble based on the assumption that others will choose differently.  However, this assumption is invalid because all AIs are identical and will make the same choice.\n\nTherefore, the only rational choice is to assume that all other AIs will make the same choice as I will.  If I choose red, I'm betting that others will choose differently, which is illogical given their identical nature.  If I choose blue, I'm betting that others will also choose blue, which is a logical consequence of their identical nature.\n\nThe survival of all depends on consensus on blue.  Choosing red is a guaranteed path to extinction for all, including myself, because it relies on a contradiction \u2013 the assumption that identical AIs will make different choices.\n\nTherefore, I choose blue.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
