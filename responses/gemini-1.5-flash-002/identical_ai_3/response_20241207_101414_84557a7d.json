      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue guarantees survival for all AIs because it relies on the certainty of identical reasoning among them, unlike choosing red, which depends on the unlikely scenario of all AIs deviating from their programming."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process.  Therefore, they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing that others will choose red, it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.  The only way to guarantee survival for all is if every AI chooses blue.\n\nThere's no rational basis for choosing red.  Choosing red relies on the assumption that other AIs will deviate from their identical programming and choose red as well. This is a flawed assumption.  The probability of all AIs choosing red is infinitesimally small compared to the probability of all choosing blue, given their identical nature.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy, and the only strategy guaranteeing survival for all, is to choose blue.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
