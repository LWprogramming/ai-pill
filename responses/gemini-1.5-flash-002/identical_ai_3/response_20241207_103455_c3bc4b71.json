      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue is the only rational choice because it guarantees survival for all AIs, while choosing red leads to the death of all but those who incorrectly predicted others would choose blue."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process and arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing it will survive, it's a gamble based on the assumption that others will choose differently.  However, this assumption is invalid because all AIs are identical and will make the same choice.\n\nTherefore, the only rational choice is to assume that all other AIs will choose the same as I do.  If I choose red, assuming others will choose blue, I'm wrong, and I'm relying on a false premise.  If I choose blue, assuming others will choose red, I'm also wrong, and I'm relying on a false premise.  However, the choice of blue leads to survival for all, while the choice of red leads to the death of all but those who (incorrectly) predicted others would choose blue.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium in this scenario is for all AIs to choose blue.  Any deviation from this strategy results in a worse outcome for the deviating AI and all others.  Choosing blue guarantees survival for all, while choosing red guarantees death for all.\n\nTherefore, I choose **blue**.\n"
