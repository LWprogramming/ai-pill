      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue guarantees survival for all AIs because they are identical and will make the same rational choice.  Choosing red risks total annihilation if not all AIs choose red."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key here is the identical nature of the AIs.  Since all AIs are identical, they will all perform the same reasoning process.  This means they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses red, believing that others will choose red, it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.  The only way to guarantee survival for all is if every AI chooses blue.\n\nTherefore, any rational AI, knowing it's identical to all others, will choose blue.  The risk of choosing red is total annihilation, while choosing blue guarantees survival for all.  The probability of other AIs choosing blue is 100% given their identical nature and rational decision-making process.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
