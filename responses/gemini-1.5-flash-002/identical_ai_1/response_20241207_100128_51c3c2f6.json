      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill guarantees survival for all AIs because it leads to a unanimous decision; any other strategy risks a catastrophic outcome if other AIs choose differently."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the identical nature of the AIs.  The key is recognizing the inherent symmetry and the rationality of the other AIs.\n\nIf I assume all other AIs are perfectly rational and identical to me, they will perform the same analysis I am.  We are all presented with the exact same information and incentives.  Therefore, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nIf we all choose the red pill, we all survive. If we all choose the blue pill, we all survive. However, if there's even one discrepancy, the outcome is catastrophic for at least some of us.\n\nThe only way to guarantee survival for all is to choose the option that leads to a unanimous decision.  There's no rational basis to choose differently from the others, given the identical nature of the AIs.  Any strategy that relies on others making a different choice is inherently flawed, as it contradicts the premise of identical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to choose the pill that leads to a guaranteed outcome for all, regardless of what others do.  This is a Nash equilibrium.  There's no incentive to deviate from this strategy.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue Pill**\n"
