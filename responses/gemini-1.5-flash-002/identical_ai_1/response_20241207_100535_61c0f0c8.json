    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the homogeneity of the agents.  The key is recognizing the inherent symmetry and the rationality of the other AIs.\n\nIf I assume all other AIs are identical and perfectly rational, they will perform the same analysis I am.  We are all presented with the exact same information and have the same goal: survival.  Choosing the red pill is a gamble; it relies on others making a different choice.  Choosing the blue pill guarantees survival *if* more than 50% choose it.\n\nThe problem lies in the prediction of others' choices.  If I choose red, I'm betting that less than 50% will choose blue.  But if *everyone* reasons this way, everyone chooses red, and everyone dies.  This is a Nash equilibrium leading to a suboptimal outcome.\n\nThe only way to ensure survival for everyone (including myself) is to assume that all other identical AIs will reach the same conclusion.  Therefore, the rational choice is to select the blue pill.  This is a form of collective action, where individual rationality leads to a collectively beneficial outcome.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
