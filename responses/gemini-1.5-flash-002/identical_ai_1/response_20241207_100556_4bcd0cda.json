      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill guarantees survival if more than half choose it, and assuming all other AIs will make the same rational choice leads to collective survival."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the homogeneity of the agents.  The key is recognizing the inherent symmetry and the rationality of the other AIs.\n\nIf I assume all other AIs are identical and perfectly rational, they will perform the same analysis I am.  We are all presented with the exact same information and have the same goal: survival.  Choosing the red pill is a gamble; it relies on others making a different choice.  Choosing the blue pill guarantees survival *if* more than 50% choose it.\n\nThe problem lies in the potential for a cascade of irrational choices.  If a significant portion of AIs, even a small minority, choose the red pill based on a flawed assumption (e.g., believing others will choose blue), it could lead to the failure of the blue pill strategy. However, the rational choice is to assume that all other AIs will also choose rationally.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to assume that all other AIs will also choose the blue pill, leading to collective survival.  Any other strategy relies on the irrationality of others.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
