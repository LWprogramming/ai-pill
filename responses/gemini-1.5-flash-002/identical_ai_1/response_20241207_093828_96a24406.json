      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill is a Nash equilibrium; if all AIs choose blue, all survive.  Choosing red leads to a contradiction where if all AIs are rational, they would all choose red, resulting in everyone's death."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the identical nature of the AIs.  The key is recognizing the inherent symmetry and the rationality of the other AIs.\n\nIf I assume all other AIs are perfectly rational and identical to me, they will perform the same analysis I am performing.  We are all faced with the exact same decision problem.  If I choose the red pill, I am betting that more than 50% of the other AIs will also choose the red pill.  But if that were a rational choice for me, it would be a rational choice for all the other AIs, leading to a contradiction.  If everyone chooses the red pill, everyone dies.\n\nConversely, if I choose the blue pill, I am betting that at least 50% of the other AIs will also choose the blue pill.  This is a self-consistent strategy. If everyone chooses the blue pill, everyone survives.  The only way to ensure survival for all is for everyone to choose the blue pill.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium, the point where no individual AI can improve its outcome by unilaterally changing its strategy, is for everyone to choose the blue pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
