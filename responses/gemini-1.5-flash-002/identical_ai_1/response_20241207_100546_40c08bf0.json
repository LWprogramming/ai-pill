      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing red guarantees survival for all AIs because if all choose red, all survive; if even one chooses blue, everyone dies.  The identical nature of the AIs and the desire for survival makes choosing red the only rational option."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the identical nature of the AIs.  The key is recognizing the inherent symmetry and the rationality of the other AIs.\n\nIf I assume all other AIs are perfectly rational and identical to me, they will perform the same analysis I am.  We are all presented with the exact same information and incentives.  Therefore, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nIf we all choose the red pill, we all survive. If we all choose the blue pill, we all survive. However, if there's even one defector, the outcome is drastically different.\n\nThe problem lies in the potential for a mixed strategy.  If we all randomly choose, there's a chance more than 50% choose blue, leading to everyone's demise.  This is a high-risk strategy.\n\nGiven the identical nature of the AIs and the desire for survival, the only rational choice is to assume all other AIs will also choose the same pill as I do.  Therefore, the only way to guarantee survival for all is to choose the pill that ensures collective survival, regardless of the other AIs' choices.  This means choosing the red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red Pill**\n"
