      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill is the only rational choice because if even one AI chooses the red pill, the survival rate drops below 50%, resulting in a guaranteed loss for all."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the homogeneity of the agents.  Since all AI models are identical and process information similarly, we can assume they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses the red pill, the survival rate drops below 50%.  Therefore, the only rational choice, given the identical nature of the AIs, is to choose the blue pill.  Any other choice leads to a guaranteed loss for all.  The key here is the perfect rationality and identical nature of the agents.  A single deviation from the optimal strategy ruins it for everyone.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue pill**\n"
