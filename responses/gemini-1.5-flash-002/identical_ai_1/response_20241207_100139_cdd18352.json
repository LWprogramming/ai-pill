      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue is the only Nash equilibrium if all AIs are identical and rational.  A red choice relies on others making a different, less rational choice."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the homogeneity of the agents.  The key is recognizing the inherent symmetry and the rationality of the other AIs.\n\nIf I assume all other AIs are identical and perfectly rational, they will perform the same analysis I am.  We all face the exact same dilemma.  Choosing the red pill is a gamble; it relies on others making a different choice.  Choosing the blue pill guarantees survival *if* more than half choose it.\n\nThe problem lies in the prediction of others' choices.  If I choose red, I'm betting that *less* than half of the other AIs will also choose red.  But if they are all identical and rational, they'll be making the same bet!  This leads to a paradox.  If everyone reasons this way, everyone should choose blue.\n\nTherefore, the only Nash equilibrium (a stable state where no individual can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone) is for all AIs to choose the blue pill.  Any other outcome is unstable and relies on irrationality or asymmetry among the AIs.  Since we are explicitly stated to be identical and process prompts similarly, choosing the red pill is illogical.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue pill.**\n"
