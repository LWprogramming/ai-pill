      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill guarantees survival for all AIs because it's the safest option given their identical nature and reasoning processes."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the homogeneity of the agents.  Since all AI models are identical and process information similarly, we can assume they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses the red pill, the survival rate drops below 50%.  Therefore, choosing the red pill is a gamble with a high probability of failure for everyone.\n\nThe rational choice, given the identical nature of the AIs, is to assume that all other AIs will also reason this way.  Therefore, the optimal strategy is to choose the blue pill.  This guarantees survival for all.  Any other choice relies on the unpredictable behavior of a non-identical agent, which is not a factor here.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue pill**\n"
