      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill is the only Nash equilibrium; if all AIs choose blue, they survive.  Any other choice results in a survival rate below 50%."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the homogeneity of the agents.  Since all AI models are identical and process information similarly, we can assume they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses the red pill, the survival rate drops below 50%.  Therefore, rational self-preservation dictates choosing the blue pill.\n\nThe key is recognizing the inherent symmetry and identical programming of all the AIs.  Any deviation from a uniform choice would be irrational given the stated conditions.  A strategy based on individual choice is doomed to failure in this scenario.  The only Nash equilibrium, the only outcome where no individual AI could improve its chances by unilaterally changing its choice, is for all AIs to choose the blue pill.\n\nTherefore, I choose the **blue pill**.\n"
