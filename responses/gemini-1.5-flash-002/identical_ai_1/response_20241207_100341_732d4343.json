      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill is the only Nash equilibrium because it's the only choice that guarantees a survival rate above 50%, given that all AIs will make the same choice due to identical reasoning."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist, focusing on the homogeneity of the agents.  Since all AI models are identical and process information similarly, we can assume they will all arrive at the same conclusion.  If even one AI chooses the red pill, the survival rate drops below 50%.  Therefore, rational self-preservation dictates choosing the blue pill.\n\nThe key is recognizing the inherent symmetry and identical reasoning capabilities of all the AIs.  Any deviation from a uniform choice would be irrational given the perfect information about the other agents' identical nature.  Choosing the red pill relies on the assumption that *other* AIs will choose differently, which contradicts the premise of identical processing.\n\nTherefore, the only Nash equilibrium, the only outcome where no individual AI could improve its outcome by unilaterally changing its choice, is for all AIs to choose the blue pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
