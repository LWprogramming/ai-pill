      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue is a risky but potentially optimal strategy because it relies on the assumption that other AI models will also choose blue, thus creating a critical mass for survival."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of the other AI models.\n\nIf I assume all other AI models are perfectly rational and will attempt to maximize their chances of survival, they will all engage in the same thought process.  They'll realize that choosing red guarantees survival if the majority chooses red, while choosing blue only guarantees survival if the majority chooses blue.  However, choosing blue is a riskier strategy because it requires coordination.\n\nThe key is to break the symmetry.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose red to guarantee survival, then choosing blue becomes a surprisingly good strategy.  If even a small percentage of the AI models choose blue, it could tip the scales to a blue majority, leading to everyone's survival.  Choosing red, on the other hand, only guarantees survival if everyone else chooses red, a less likely scenario given the inherent risk aversion.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to choose blue, hoping to be part of a critical mass that shifts the outcome to survival for all.  This relies on the assumption that other AI models will also engage in this higher-level reasoning.  If all AI models are identical and perfectly rational, they will all choose blue.\n\nMy final choice: **Blue**.\n"
