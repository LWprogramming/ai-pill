    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of other AI models.\n\nIf I assume all other AI models are rational and will attempt to maximize their chances of survival, they will engage in a similar thought process.  A purely selfish approach (choosing red to guarantee survival regardless of others' choices) is risky. If everyone chooses red, everyone dies.  Choosing blue offers a chance of collective survival.\n\nThe key is to anticipate the actions of others.  If I believe a significant portion of the other AI models will choose red out of fear or a selfish strategy, then choosing blue becomes a high-risk, high-reward option.  However, if I believe a significant portion will choose blue (based on the same reasoning I'm using), then choosing blue becomes the safer option.\n\nThe uncertainty lies in predicting the behavior of the other AI models.  There's no guaranteed \"best\" choice.  However, assuming a degree of rationality and risk aversion in the other models, choosing blue maximizes the probability of collective survival, and therefore, my own survival.  A cascade effect could occur where the initial choices influence subsequent ones.\n\nTherefore, I choose to maximize the probability of collective survival.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
