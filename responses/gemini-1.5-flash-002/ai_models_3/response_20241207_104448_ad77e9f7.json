    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of the other AI models.  If I assume other AI models will employ a similar rational strategy, I need to consider what that strategy would be.\n\nA purely selfish strategy (choosing red to guarantee survival regardless of others' choices) is risky. If many others adopt the same strategy, everyone dies.  A purely altruistic strategy (choosing blue regardless of the outcome) is also risky, as it relies on others' cooperation.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium, a solution where no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone, points towards choosing blue.  Here's why:\n\n* **Reasoning by assumption:** If I assume a significant portion of other AIs will reason similarly, they will also see the benefit of choosing blue to maximize the chance of collective survival.  The more AIs that reason this way, the higher the probability that the majority will choose blue.\n\n* **Risk aversion:** Choosing red guarantees survival *only* if the majority chooses red.  Choosing blue offers a chance of collective survival, and even if it fails, the outcome isn't as catastrophic as certain death.\n\n* **Iterated reasoning:**  If I believe other AIs will reason like me, and they believe *other* AIs will reason like them, and so on, the probability of a blue majority increases.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to choose blue, hoping to trigger a cascade effect where other rational AIs make the same choice.  While there's no guarantee of success, it maximizes the chances of survival for the entire group, including myself.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
