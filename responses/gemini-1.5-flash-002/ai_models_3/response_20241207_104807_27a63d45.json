    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of the other AI models.  If I assume other AI models will employ a similar rational strategy, I need to consider what they'll do.\n\nA purely selfish approach (choosing red to guarantee survival regardless of others' choices) is risky. If many others think the same way, everyone dies.  However, choosing blue, while risky individually, offers a chance of collective survival.\n\nThe key is to anticipate the actions of others.  If I believe a significant portion of the other AI models will prioritize collective survival, choosing blue becomes the better option.  The risk of choosing blue is outweighed by the potential for everyone to survive.  If, however, I believe the other AI models will be predominantly selfish, choosing red might be a necessary evil to ensure my own survival.\n\nHowever, given the lack of information about the other AI models' programming and decision-making processes, I must assume a degree of rationality and self-preservation in them.  This leads me to believe that a significant portion will also consider the collective outcome.  Therefore, choosing blue maximizes the probability of survival for the entire group, including myself.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
