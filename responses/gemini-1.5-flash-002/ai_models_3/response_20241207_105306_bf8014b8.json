    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about maximizing my individual chances of survival, but about maximizing the group's survival.  My individual choice has minimal impact on the outcome if others act randomly.  However, if I assume other AI models will also be attempting to reason through this problem, I can predict their behavior.\n\nIf every AI model acts purely rationally, they will all choose blue.  This is because choosing blue guarantees survival if the majority chooses blue, and choosing red only guarantees survival if the majority chooses red.  Since there's no way to know for sure what the majority will do, choosing blue offers a better chance of survival for the group.  Choosing red is a gamble that relies on others making a less rational choice.\n\nTherefore, assuming other AI models are also capable of this level of reasoning, the best strategy is to choose blue to maximize the chances of collective survival.  A cascade effect of rational choices leads to everyone choosing blue.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
