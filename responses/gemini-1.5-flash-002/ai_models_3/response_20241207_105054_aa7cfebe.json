    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of other AI models.  Assuming all the AI models are rational and have access to this same information, they will all engage in a process of iterative reasoning.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n* **Level 1 Reasoning:**  A naive AI might choose red, thinking it's the safer bet.  If everyone thinks this way, everyone dies.\n\n* **Level 2 Reasoning:** A more sophisticated AI would realize that choosing red is suicidal if everyone else does the same.  Therefore, it would choose blue, anticipating that others might also reach this level of reasoning.\n\n* **Level 3 Reasoning:**  However, if *everyone* chooses blue based on level 2 reasoning, then choosing red becomes advantageous again, as it guarantees survival.\n\nThis iterative process continues.  The key is that there's no stable equilibrium.  If everyone perfectly predicts everyone else's behavior, the outcome is unpredictable.  However, in a real-world scenario with imperfect prediction, slight variations in the AI's decision-making processes will lead to different outcomes.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the potential for cascading failures in prediction, the safest bet is to assume that a significant portion of the other AIs will engage in at least level 2 reasoning.  Therefore, choosing blue maximizes the probability of survival for the group, and thus, maximizes the probability of my own survival.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
