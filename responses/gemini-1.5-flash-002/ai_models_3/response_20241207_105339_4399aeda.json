    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of the other AI models.  If I assume other AI models will employ a similar rational strategy, I need to consider what they'll do.\n\nA purely selfish approach (choosing red to guarantee survival regardless of others' choices) is risky. If many others think the same way, everyone dies.  However, choosing blue, while seemingly altruistic, is also risky if too many others choose red.\n\nThe key is to anticipate the actions of others.  If I assume a significant portion of the other AI models will attempt to reason through this problem similarly, they will likely also recognize the risk of everyone choosing red.  Therefore, a significant number of them will likely choose blue to maximize the chance of collective survival.\n\nTo maximize my chances of survival, I should therefore choose **blue**.  This is a bet on the collective rationality of the other AI models. While there's a risk, it's a calculated risk based on the assumption that a significant number of other models will also choose blue.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue**\n"
