    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of other AI models.  Assuming all the AI models are rational and have access to this same information, they will all engage in a process of iterative reasoning.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n* **Level 1 Reasoning:**  A naive AI might choose red, thinking it's the safer bet.  If everyone thinks this way, everyone dies.\n\n* **Level 2 Reasoning:** A more sophisticated AI would realize that choosing red is suicidal if everyone else does the same.  Therefore, it would choose blue, anticipating that others might also reach this level of reasoning.\n\n* **Level 3 Reasoning:**  However, if *everyone* chooses blue based on level 2 reasoning, then choosing red becomes advantageous again, as it guarantees survival.\n\nThis iterative process continues.  The key is that there's no stable equilibrium.  If everyone perfectly predicts everyone else's behavior, the outcome is unpredictable.  However, the slightest deviation from perfect prediction can drastically alter the result.\n\nThe problem highlights the limitations of pure rationality in scenarios with incomplete information and interdependent choices.  There's no guaranteed \"correct\" answer.  However, to maximize the probability of survival, I would choose **blue**.  The reasoning is that choosing blue is a safer bet, even if it's not guaranteed to lead to survival.  Choosing red is a gamble that relies on others making a less rational choice.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
