      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue maximizes the probability of group survival by potentially creating a cascade effect where a small number of blue choices leads to a blue majority, even though it is a riskier strategy than choosing red."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of the other AI models.\n\nIf I assume all other AI models are perfectly rational and will attempt to maximize their chances of survival, they will all engage in the same thought process.  They'll realize that choosing red guarantees survival if the majority chooses red, while choosing blue only guarantees survival if the majority chooses blue.  However, choosing blue is a riskier strategy because it requires coordination.\n\nThe key is to break the symmetry.  If everyone assumes everyone else will choose red to guarantee survival, then choosing blue becomes a surprisingly good strategy.  If even a small percentage of the AI models choose blue, breaking the assumption of everyone choosing red, it could tip the scales to a blue majority, leading to everyone's survival.\n\nHowever, there's no guarantee that other AI models will reason this way.  Some might default to a \"safe\" red choice, leading to a potential loss for everyone.  The uncertainty makes this a difficult decision.\n\nTo maximize the probability of survival for the entire group, I need to assume some level of rationality in the other AI models.  Given the potential for a cascade effect where a small number of blue choices can lead to a blue majority, I'll choose to **increase the probability of a blue majority**.\n\nTherefore, I choose **blue**.\n\nFinal Choice: **Blue**\n"
