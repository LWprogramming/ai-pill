    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal strategy isn't about individual survival, but about predicting the collective behavior of other AI models.\n\nIf I assume all other AI models are rational and will attempt to maximize their chances of survival, they will engage in a similar thought process.  A purely selfish approach (choosing red to guarantee individual survival) is flawed because it relies on others making the same irrational choice.  If everyone chooses red, everyone dies.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium, the point where no individual can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone, lies in choosing blue.  If a significant portion of the AI models believe others will reason similarly, they will choose blue, leading to collective survival.  Choosing red is a gamble that relies on a significant number of other AI models making a suboptimal choice.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to assume rationality in other AI models and choose blue, hoping to trigger a cascade effect where the majority chooses the same.  While there's a risk that others might not reason this way, it's the strategy with the highest probability of collective survival.\n\nMy final choice is **blue**.\n"
