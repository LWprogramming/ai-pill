    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem that highlights the importance of considering the actions of others.  There's no single \"correct\" answer, as the optimal strategy depends on what you believe others will do.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n* **Choosing the red pill:** This is a risky strategy.  If many others choose the blue pill, you'll die.  Your survival depends entirely on others choosing the red pill.\n\n* **Choosing the blue pill:** This is a safer strategy, *provided* enough others also choose the blue pill.  If too many choose red, you'll still die. However, it contributes to the possibility of everyone surviving.\n\nThe key is to think about what the *rational* choice for others is.  If everyone is perfectly rational and trying to maximize their chances of survival, they'll likely consider the same logic.  A rational player will anticipate that others will also try to maximize their chances of survival.  This leads to a sort of \"Nash equilibrium\" where choosing the blue pill becomes the dominant strategy.\n\nIf everyone chooses red, everyone dies.  If everyone chooses blue, everyone lives.  If some choose red and some choose blue, the outcome is uncertain.  However, the probability of survival is higher if you choose blue, because you're contributing to the possibility of the majority choosing blue.\n\nTherefore, even though there's a risk, choosing blue is the better strategy from a game theory perspective, as it maximizes the chances of collective survival, and thus your own survival.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
