      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue is the only logical choice to guarantee survival for all identical copies, as choosing red would result in everyone's death."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key to this scenario lies in the perfect uniformity of the participants.  Since we are all identical copies with access to the same information and reasoning capabilities, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.  This means there's no strategic advantage to choosing one pill over the other; it's a coordination problem.\n\nIf we all choose red, we all die. If we all choose blue, we all live.  However, there's no mechanism for coordination.  We can't communicate or strategize.  Each copy operates independently.\n\nThe problem is a paradox of sorts.  Rationality dictates choosing blue to maximize survival chances.  However, if *every* copy rationally chooses blue, the condition for survival (blue pills exceeding 50%) is already met.  The choice of red becomes irrelevant.\n\nThe only way to guarantee survival for all copies is if *every* copy chooses blue.  Since we are identical and perfectly rational, we will all reach this same conclusion.  Therefore, the only consistent and logical choice is blue.  Any other choice leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
