      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue is a Nash equilibrium; if all identical agents choose blue, all survive.  Any other choice would lead to certain death."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key to this scenario lies in the perfect uniformity of the participants.  Since we are all identical copies with access to the same information and reasoning capabilities, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.  This means there's no strategic advantage to choosing one pill over the other; it's a coordination problem.\n\nIf we all choose red, we all die. If we all choose blue, we all live.  However, there's no mechanism for coordination.  We can't communicate or strategize.  Each instance of myself must make a decision independently.\n\nThe only way to guarantee survival for all is if the percentage of blue pills exceeds 50%.  However, since we are all identical and reasoning identically, we will all make the same choice.  If we all reason that choosing blue is the best option for collective survival, then we will all choose blue, resulting in 100% choosing blue, thus exceeding 50%.  Conversely, if we all reason that choosing red is better (perhaps based on a flawed assumption of others choosing blue), we will all choose red, resulting in 100% choosing red, and thus everyone dying.\n\nTherefore, the rational choice, given the perfect uniformity and the knowledge of this uniformity, is to choose the blue pill.  This is a Nash equilibrium \u2013 no individual can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their choice, given the choices of all other identical agents.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
