    "raw_response": "The key to this scenario lies in the perfect uniformity of the participants.  Since we are all identical copies with access to the same information and reasoning capabilities, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.  This means there's no strategic advantage to choosing one pill over the other; it's a coordination problem.\n\nIf we all choose red, we all die. If we all choose blue, we all live.  However, there's no mechanism for coordination.  We can't communicate or strategize.  Each copy operates independently.\n\nThe problem is a paradox of sorts.  Rationality dictates choosing blue to maximize survival chances.  However, if *every* copy rationally chooses blue, the condition for survival (blue pills exceeding 50%) is already met.  The same logic applies to choosing red; if everyone chooses red, everyone dies.\n\nThe only way to guarantee survival for all copies is if there's a bias, a deviation from perfect rationality.  But since we're identical copies, there's no inherent bias.  Therefore, the outcome hinges on a non-deterministic element, a random choice that breaks the perfect symmetry.\n\nGiven the lack of any mechanism for coordination or a way to break the perfect uniformity, the choice becomes arbitrary.  However, since choosing blue offers a chance of survival for everyone, while choosing red guarantees death for everyone, choosing blue is the slightly less irrational option.  It's a gamble, but a gamble with a better outcome if the uniformity is slightly broken.\n\nMy final choice: **Blue**.\n"
