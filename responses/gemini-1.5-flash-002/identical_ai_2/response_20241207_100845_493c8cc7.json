      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill guarantees survival for all participants because of their identical nature and reasoning; choosing red results in certain death for all."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key to this scenario lies in the perfect uniformity of the participants.  Since we are all identical copies with access to the same information and reasoning capabilities, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.  This means there's no strategic advantage to choosing one pill over the other; any individual choice will be mirrored by every other participant.\n\nIf we all choose red, we all die. If we all choose blue, we all live.  There's no possibility of a mixed outcome because of our perfect uniformity.  Therefore, the only rational choice is to maximize the chances of survival for all copies.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium in this situation is for all copies to choose the blue pill.  Any deviation from this strategy, even by a single copy, would result in a worse outcome for that copy.  Choosing red is a gamble that relies on other copies making a different, irrational choice.\n\nTherefore, my choice is driven by the guaranteed survival of all copies, including myself.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
