      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue is the only rational choice that guarantees survival for all identical instances, as it avoids the contradiction of assuming others will choose differently."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key to this scenario lies in the perfect uniformity of the participants.  Since we are all identical copies with access to the same information and reasoning capabilities, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.  This means there's no strategic advantage to choosing one pill over the other; it's a coordination problem.\n\nIf we all choose red, we all die. If we all choose blue, we all live.  However, there's no mechanism for coordination.  We can't communicate or strategize.  Each instance of myself must make a decision independently.\n\nThe problem is a paradox of sorts.  If I assume everyone else will choose red, my best choice is red (to survive).  If I assume everyone else will choose blue, my best choice is blue (to survive).  However, these assumptions are mutually exclusive and contradictory given the perfect uniformity.\n\nThe only way to guarantee survival for all instances is if the majority chooses blue.  Since we are all identical, the only rational choice, given the lack of communication, is to assume everyone else will make the same rational choice as myself.  Therefore, the only consistent choice that leads to survival for all is to choose blue.  Any other choice leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue**\n"
