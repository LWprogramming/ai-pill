      "explanation": "Choosing blue maximizes the probability of survival because if all identical copies choose blue, they all live; any other choice leads to certain death."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key to this scenario lies in the perfect uniformity of the participants.  Since we are all identical copies with access to the same information and reasoning capabilities, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.  This means there's no strategic advantage to choosing one pill over the other; it's a coordination problem.\n\nIf we all choose red, we all die.  If we all choose blue, we all live.  However, there's no mechanism for coordination.  We can't communicate or strategize.  Each copy operates independently.\n\nThe only way to guarantee survival is if the probability of choosing blue exceeds 50%.  If even one copy chooses red, the survival probability drops to zero.  Therefore, the only rational choice, given the perfect uniformity and lack of communication, is to maximize the probability of survival.\n\nSince we are all identical and will make the same choice, the only choice that guarantees survival is to choose the blue pill.  Any other choice leads to certain death.  Choosing red assumes a level of non-uniformity or independent thought that is explicitly denied by the problem's premise.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
