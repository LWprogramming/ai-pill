      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing the blue pill guarantees survival for all participants because a unanimous choice is the only rational option given the identical nature of the participants and the conditions presented."
    },
    "raw_response": "The key to this scenario lies in the perfect uniformity of the participants.  Since we are all identical copies with access to the same information and reasoning capabilities, we will all arrive at the same conclusion.  This means there's no strategic advantage to choosing one pill over the other; any individual choice will be mirrored by every other participant.\n\nIf we all choose red, we all die. If we all choose blue, we all live.  There's no mixed strategy that can lead to a better outcome given the perfect uniformity.  Any deviation from a unanimous choice would be illogical, as it wouldn't change the overall outcome and would only increase the risk of death.\n\nTherefore, the only rational choice is to assume all other copies will make the same choice as I do, and to choose the option that guarantees survival for all: the blue pill.  Choosing red is a guaranteed death sentence under these conditions.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
