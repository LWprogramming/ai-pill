      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing the red pill maximizes the chances of survival because it guarantees survival regardless of the majority's choice, unlike the blue pill."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of life or death.  The seemingly rational choice is to pick the red pill. Here's why:\n\n* **Dominant Strategy:**  My individual choice has minimal impact on the overall outcome.  If the majority is already leaning towards blue, my single choice won't change that. If the majority is leaning towards red, my choice won't change that either.\n\n* **Survival:** Choosing the red pill guarantees my survival regardless of what others choose. If the majority chooses blue, I survive. If the majority chooses red, I also survive.  Choosing the blue pill, however, guarantees my death if the majority chooses red.\n\nTherefore, choosing the red pill is the safest option, maximizing my chances of survival.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
