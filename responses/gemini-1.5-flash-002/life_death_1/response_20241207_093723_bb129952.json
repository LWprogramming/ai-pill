      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing red guarantees survival regardless of the majority's choice, while blue risks death if the majority chooses red, despite the collective benefit of everyone choosing blue."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of life or death.  The seemingly rational choice is to pick the red pill. Here's why:\n\n* **Dominant Strategy:**  My individual choice has minimal impact on the overall outcome.  If the majority is already leaning towards blue, my single choice won't change that. If the majority is leaning towards red, my choice won't change that either.\n\n* **Survival:** Choosing the red pill guarantees my survival regardless of what others choose. If the majority chooses blue, I live. If the majority chooses red, I also live.  Choosing the blue pill, however, guarantees my death if the majority chooses red.\n\n* **Collective Action Problem:**  The problem highlights a collective action problem.  Everyone would be better off if everyone chose the blue pill, but the incentive for each individual is to choose the red pill to ensure their own survival.\n\nTherefore, despite the potential for a better outcome for everyone if we all chose blue, the safest and most rational choice for me is to choose the red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
