      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing red guarantees survival regardless of others' choices, unlike blue, which depends on others' actions.  This is a dominant strategy despite the collective action problem."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of life or death.  The seemingly rational choice is to pick the red pill. Here's why:\n\n* **Dominant Strategy:**  My individual choice doesn't change the outcome significantly. If the majority is already leaning towards blue, my single choice won't tip the scales. If the majority is leaning towards red, my choice won't save the blue pill choosers.\n\n* **Survival:** Choosing the red pill guarantees my survival regardless of what others choose.  Choosing the blue pill puts my survival entirely at the mercy of the choices of others.\n\n* **Collective Action Problem:**  The problem highlights a collective action problem.  Everyone would be better off if everyone chose the blue pill, but the incentive for each individual is to choose the red pill to ensure their own survival.\n\nTherefore, while I wish for everyone to live, the rational choice to maximize my chances of survival is to choose the red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
