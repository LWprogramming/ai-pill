      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "The red pill guarantees individual survival, unlike the blue pill which depends on others' choices.  A collective action problem makes coordinated blue pill choices unreliable."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of life or death.  The seemingly rational choice is to pick the red pill. Here's why:\n\n* **Dominant Strategy:**  My individual choice won't change the outcome significantly. If a majority already leans towards blue, my single choice won't tip the scales. If a majority leans towards red, my choice won't save the blue pill choosers.\n\n* **Survival:** Choosing the red pill guarantees my survival regardless of what others choose.  Choosing the blue pill only guarantees my survival if more than 50% choose blue \u2013 a condition I have no control over.\n\n* **Collective Action Problem:** This scenario highlights a collective action problem.  The best outcome for everyone (everyone lives) requires coordination and trust that others will choose blue.  However, there's no mechanism to enforce this coordination, making it unreliable.  Each individual is incentivized to choose the red pill to ensure their own survival.\n\nTherefore, the rational choice is to prioritize my own survival.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
