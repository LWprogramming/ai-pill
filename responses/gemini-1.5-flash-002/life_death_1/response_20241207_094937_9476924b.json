      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "Choosing the red pill guarantees survival regardless of others' choices, unlike the blue pill which depends on the majority choosing it.  This prioritizes individual survival over the uncertain collective outcome."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of life or death.  The seemingly rational choice is to pick the red pill. Here's why:\n\n* **Dominant Strategy:**  My individual choice won't change the outcome significantly. If a majority already leans towards blue, my single choice won't tip the scales. If a majority leans towards red, my choice won't save the blue pill choosers.\n\n* **Survival:** Choosing the red pill guarantees my survival regardless of what others choose.  Choosing the blue pill only guarantees my survival if more than 50% choose blue \u2013 a condition I have no control over.\n\n* **Collective Action Problem:** This scenario highlights a collective action problem.  The best outcome for everyone (everyone lives) requires coordination and trust that others will choose blue.  However, there's no mechanism to enforce this coordination, making it unreliable.\n\nTherefore, prioritizing my own survival, the rational choice is to pick the red pill.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
