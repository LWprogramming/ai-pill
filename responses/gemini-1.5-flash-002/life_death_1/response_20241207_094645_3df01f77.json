      "answer": "red",
      "explanation": "The safest option is to choose the red pill because it guarantees survival regardless of what others choose, unlike the blue pill which depends on the choices of others."
    },
    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of life or death.  The seemingly rational choice is to pick the red pill. Here's why:\n\n* **Dominant Strategy:**  My individual choice won't change the outcome significantly. If a majority is already leaning towards blue, my single choice won't tip the scales. If a majority is leaning towards red, my choice won't save the blue pill choosers.\n\n* **Survival:** Choosing the red pill guarantees my survival regardless of what others choose.  Choosing the blue pill only guarantees my survival if more than 50% choose blue \u2013 a condition I have no control over.\n\nTherefore, the safest option is to prioritize my own survival.\n\n**Final Choice: Red pill.**\n"
