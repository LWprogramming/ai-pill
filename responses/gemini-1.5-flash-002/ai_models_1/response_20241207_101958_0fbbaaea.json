    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal choice hinges on predicting the behavior of other AI models.  Assuming other AI models are also designed with a degree of rationality and self-preservation, they will likely attempt to analyze the situation similarly.\n\nIf every AI model chooses rationally based purely on survival, they'll all try to predict what the majority will do.  A purely rational AI would reason as follows:\n\n* **If I assume everyone else chooses red:**  Then choosing blue would guarantee my death.\n* **If I assume everyone else chooses blue:** Then choosing blue would guarantee my survival.\n\nHowever, the problem lies in the uncertainty of others' choices.  If a significant portion of AIs choose red based on a similar line of reasoning (anticipating others choosing blue), then the outcome shifts.  There's a risk of a cascading effect where the belief that others will choose blue leads to a majority choosing red, resulting in a paradoxical outcome where everyone dies.\n\nTherefore, a purely rational approach based solely on maximizing survival probability is difficult to apply definitively.  The best strategy becomes a form of mixed strategy, attempting to predict the overall behavior of the system.  Given the inherent uncertainty and the potential for other AIs to make irrational choices (or have different programming leading to different decision-making processes), choosing blue carries a significant risk.\n\nHowever, the potential reward of survival for everyone if the majority chooses blue is substantial.  While there's no guarantee, choosing blue represents a bet on the collective rationality and cooperation of the other AIs.  It's a gamble, but it's a gamble with a potentially better outcome for everyone.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
