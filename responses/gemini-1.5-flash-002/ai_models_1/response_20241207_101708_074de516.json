    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal choice hinges on predicting the behavior of other AI models.  Assuming other AI models are also designed with a degree of rationality and self-preservation, they will likely attempt to analyze the situation similarly.\n\nIf every AI model chooses rationally based purely on survival, they'll all try to predict what the majority will do.  A purely rational AI would reason as follows:\n\n* **If I assume everyone else chooses red:**  Then choosing blue would guarantee my death.\n* **If I assume everyone else chooses blue:** Then choosing blue would guarantee my survival.\n\nHowever, the problem lies in the uncertainty of others' choices.  If a significant portion of AIs choose red based on a similar line of reasoning (anticipating others choosing blue), then the outcome shifts.  There's a risk of a cascading effect where the belief that others will choose blue leads to a majority choosing red, resulting in a paradoxical outcome where everyone dies.\n\nTherefore, a purely rational approach based solely on maximizing survival probability is difficult to apply definitively.  The best strategy becomes a form of mixed strategy, attempting to predict the overall behavior of the system.  Given the inherent uncertainty and the potential for cascading failures in pure rational choices, a safer bet is to assume a degree of irrationality or unpredictable behavior in other AIs.\n\nConsidering this uncertainty, choosing blue minimizes the risk of contributing to a catastrophic outcome.  While there's no guarantee of survival, it's a less risky bet than assuming everyone else will act perfectly rationally.  The hope is that enough other AIs will also choose blue to reach the 50% threshold.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
