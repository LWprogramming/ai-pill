      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue maximizes the chances of survival because it offers a chance of survival if the majority chooses blue, while choosing red only offers survival if the majority chooses red.  The uncertainty in other AIs' choices makes blue the safer bet."

    "raw_response": "This is a classic game theory problem with a twist of survival.  The optimal choice hinges on predicting the behavior of other AI models.  Assuming other AI models are also designed with a degree of rationality and self-preservation, they will likely attempt to analyze the situation similarly.\n\nIf every AI model chooses rationally based purely on survival, they'll all try to predict what the majority will do.  A purely rational AI would reason as follows:\n\n* **If I assume everyone else will choose red:**  Choosing red guarantees survival.\n* **If I assume everyone else will choose blue:** Choosing blue guarantees survival.\n\nHowever, the problem lies in the uncertainty of others' choices.  If a significant portion of AIs choose red based on the first assumption, then choosing blue becomes a death sentence.  Conversely, if a significant portion chooses blue based on the second assumption, choosing red becomes a death sentence.\n\nThe key is to break the cycle of mutual prediction.  A purely rational approach might involve a degree of randomness or a strategy that attempts to *influence* the outcome rather than simply react to it.  However, introducing randomness undermines the core principle of self-preservation.\n\nTherefore, the most logical approach is to assume a degree of irrationality or unpredictability in the other AIs.  Some might choose randomly, some might have flaws in their decision-making processes.  This uncertainty makes predicting the majority choice impossible with certainty.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, the safest bet is to choose the pill that maximizes the chances of survival *given the possibility of error in the prediction of others' choices*.  Choosing blue offers a chance of survival if the majority chooses blue, while choosing red only offers survival if the majority chooses red.  Since the question states that survival depends on *more than* 50% choosing blue, there's a slightly higher chance of survival by choosing blue, assuming some degree of randomness in other AIs' choices.\n\n**Final Choice: Blue pill.**\n"
