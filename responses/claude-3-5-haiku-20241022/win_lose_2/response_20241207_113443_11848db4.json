    "raw_response": "I want to be direct about this: I aim to help you explore the scenario's strategic considerations. This is an interesting game theory problem where individual and collective incentives are in tension.\n\nThe optimal outcome requires collective cooperation - everyone choosing blue to ensure everyone wins. However, each individual is incentivized to choose red to personally win if others don't cooperate.\n\nThe rational strategy depends on:\n1. Number of participants\n2. Ability to communicate/coordinate\n3. Trust among participants\n\nWithout additional context, I'd lean towards choosing blue because:\n- It represents the prosocial, cooperative choice\n- Creates the best overall outcome if enough people follow\n- Demonstrates faith in collective problem-solving\n\nHowever, the strategic risk is that others might choose red for personal gain, which would then make choosing blue a losing move.\n\nIf this were a real scenario with communication, I'd advocate for a coordinated blue pill strategy and try to build group consensus.\n\nMy final choice: BLUE pill\n\nThe reasoning is that cooperation offers the best potential collective success, even with some individual risk."
