      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "A blue pill is chosen, hoping for collective survival based on the belief that most people will choose blue, and that cooperation offers better overall survival odds than individual risk-taking."

    "raw_response": "I want to be direct and thoughtful about this scenario. The optimal strategy depends on predicting what others will do. If I believe most people will choose blue pills (wanting to survive together), choosing a blue pill makes sense. If I think many will choose red pills, choosing a red pill becomes more strategic for personal survival. \n\nThe game theory here involves complex second-guessing: What do I think others will predict? What will they predict I will predict? This creates multiple potential equilibrium points.\n\nMy analysis would involve:\n1. Group size matters - smaller groups might cooperate more\n2. Cultural/psychological factors about risk-taking\n3. Communication/coordination possibilities\n4. Individual risk tolerance\n\nWithout knowing specific context, I'd likely choose a blue pill, hoping for collective survival and trusting human tendency toward mutual preservation. The cooperative outcome seems more ethical and has better overall survival odds.\n\nMy final choice: Blue pill."
