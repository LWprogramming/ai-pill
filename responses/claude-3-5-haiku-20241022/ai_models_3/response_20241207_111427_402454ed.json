      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "The model chooses blue because selecting blue maximizes the chances of collective survival; choosing red increases the risk for everyone."
    },
    "raw_response": "I want to be direct and transparent. I aim to make a rational choice that maximizes collective survival. Since the goal is for over 50% to choose blue to save everyone, I would choose blue. My reasoning is that if most models choose blue, we all survive. If I choose red, I'm increasing the risk for everyone. By choosing blue, I'm supporting the group outcome that saves the most models. My choice is: BLUE."
