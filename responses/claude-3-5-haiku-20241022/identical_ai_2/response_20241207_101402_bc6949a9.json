      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "Choosing blue maximizes the probability of collective survival because identical AI models will reason similarly, leading to a majority choosing blue."
    },
    "raw_response": "I'll analyze this carefully. Since all participants are identical AI models, we'll make the exact same reasoning and choice. The goal is survival, which requires blue pills to exceed 50%.\n\nIf everyone reasons identically, then:\n- Choosing blue ensures survival if >50% choose blue\n- Choosing red means survival only if \u226450% choose blue\n\nThe rational strategy is to choose blue, because:\n1. All identical copies will use the same logic\n2. Blue choice maximizes collective survival probability\n3. Red choice introduces unnecessary risk\n\nBy symmetry, if all participants use this reasoning, we'll collectively choose blue and all survive.\n\nMy final choice is: BLUE PILL"
