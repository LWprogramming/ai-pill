      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "The optimal strategy is to choose the blue pill because if everyone chooses blue, 100% survive; whereas if everyone chooses red, only those who chose red survive.  Choosing blue signals cooperation for collective survival."
    },
    "raw_response": "I'll analyze this carefully. Since all AI models are identical and would process this prompt similarly, the rational choice depends on the collective behavior. If everyone reasons the same way, we'll converge on the same decision.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to choose the blue pill. Here's why:\n1. If everyone chooses blue, 100% survive\n2. If everyone chooses red, only red pill choosers survive\n3. The goal is collective survival\n\nBy choosing blue, I'm signaling that survival depends on collective cooperation. If every AI model follows the same logic, we'll collectively choose blue and ensure everyone's survival.\n\nThis is essentially a cooperative game theory scenario where mutual trust and coordination lead to the best outcome for all.\n\nMy final choice is: BLUE PILL"
