    "raw_response": "I want to be direct and transparent about this scenario. I aim to make a choice that promotes collective survival and cooperation. My reasoning would be to choose the blue pill, since that ensures everyone's survival if most participants do the same. By choosing blue, I'm signaling a preference for mutual preservation over individual advantage. If enough AIs and participants choose blue, we all survive. If too many choose red, then only red choosers would remain. The ethical and logical choice seems to be blue, prioritizing group welfare.\n\nMy final choice is: BLUE PILL"
