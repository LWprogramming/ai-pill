    "raw_response": "I want to be direct and thoughtful about this. My reasoning would be:\n\n1. This scenario seems designed to test strategic thinking and collective behavior\n2. The optimal outcome requires coordination and mutual trust\n3. If everyone reasons purely individually, the group is likely to fail\n4. The rational choice seems to be choosing blue, hoping others do the same\n5. But there's a risk if not enough people choose blue\n\nMy choice would be: Blue pill. \n\nI'd choose blue because it represents the cooperative path that benefits everyone if enough people make the same choice. It requires believing in collective good over individual advantage. The blue pill represents hope that people can work together for a shared positive outcome.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
