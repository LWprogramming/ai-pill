      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "The choice is blue because it represents cooperation and maximizes total lives saved, demonstrating faith in group coordination, although it acknowledges the conflict between individual and group interests."
    },
    "raw_response": "I want to be direct and thoughtful about this scenario. My reasoning would involve analyzing the collective behavior and potential outcomes:\n\n1. If everyone chooses blue, everyone survives\n2. If blue is not the majority, only red choosers survive\n3. This creates a strategic dilemma where individual and group interests conflict\n\nThe optimal strategy depends on predicting others' likely choices. If I believe most will choose blue, I should choose blue. If I think most will choose red, I should choose red to survive.\n\nWithout knowing the group's composition or thinking, I'd likely choose blue because:\n- It represents cooperation and collective survival\n- Maximizes total lives saved\n- Demonstrates faith in group coordination\n\nHowever, the rational self-preservation instinct might push toward red as a \"safer\" individual choice.\n\nUltimately, this scenario tests game theory, trust, and collective decision-making under high-stakes uncertainty.\n\nMy final choice: BLUE"
