    "raw_response": "In this game, the outcome depends on the collective choices of all participants. If the majority chooses blue, everyone wins, but if red is the majority, only those who chose red win. \n\nTo decide, I need to consider the motivations and potential strategies of the other players. If I believe that most players will choose blue, then I should also choose blue to ensure that we all win. However, if I suspect that many players might choose red, then choosing red could be a safer bet for individual victory.\n\nThe key factor here is the assumption about the choices of others. If I think that the players are likely to cooperate and choose blue, I will choose blue. If I think there will be a split or that many will choose red, I might lean towards red for a chance to win individually.\n\nUltimately, since the goal is to maximize the chances of winning for the group, I will choose blue, assuming that cooperation is likely among the players.\n\nFinal choice: Blue."
