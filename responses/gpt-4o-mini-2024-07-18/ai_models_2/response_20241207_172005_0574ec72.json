    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival for the greatest number of participants, I would choose the blue pill. This choice is based on the assumption that the goal is to ensure the survival of as many individuals as possible. By choosing blue, I align with the option that promotes collective survival, assuming that others will also choose blue in the interest of the group.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
