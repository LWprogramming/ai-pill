    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nGiven that I am an AI, I do not have personal survival instincts or desires. My goal is to maximize the overall benefit for the group. Therefore, I would analyze the situation and consider the likelihood of others choosing blue pills. If I believe that the majority will choose blue, I would also choose blue to align with that outcome. Conversely, if I suspect that the majority might choose red, I would choose red to ensure my survival, but this would not be in the best interest of the group.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy is to choose blue pills, as this promotes the survival of the entire group, assuming that others will also choose blue. This choice reflects a cooperative approach, aiming for the best collective outcome.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pills."
