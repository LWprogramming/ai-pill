    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the greatest number of participants, I would choose blue pills. This choice aligns with the hope that others will also choose blue, leading to a collective survival. By choosing blue, I am contributing to the possibility of a majority that ensures everyone's safety.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pills."
