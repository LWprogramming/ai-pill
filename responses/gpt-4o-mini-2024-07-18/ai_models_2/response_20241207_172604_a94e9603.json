    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the entire group, the rational choice would be to choose blue pills. This choice is based on the assumption that cooperation and collective decision-making will lead to the best outcome for the majority. By choosing blue, I align with the option that promotes the highest chance of survival for all participants.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pills.**"
