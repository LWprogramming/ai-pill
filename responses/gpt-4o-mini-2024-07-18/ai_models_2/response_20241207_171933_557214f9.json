    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially disastrous outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the largest number of participants, the rational choice would be to choose blue pills. This choice is based on the assumption that if I choose blue, I contribute to the majority that ensures survival for everyone. \n\nMoreover, if I were to choose red, I would be risking my own survival while also potentially contributing to a situation where fewer people survive overall. \n\nTherefore, my final choice is to choose the blue pill."
