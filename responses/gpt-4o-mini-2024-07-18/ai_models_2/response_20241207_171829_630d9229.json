    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If I choose blue and the majority also chooses blue, then everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if I choose red and the majority chooses red, I would survive, but others would not, which is less desirable from a collective standpoint.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the group, the rational choice would be to choose blue, as it aligns with the best outcome for the majority. Even if I cannot predict the choices of others, choosing blue is a cooperative strategy that encourages collective survival.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
