    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a loss for those who chose blue.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival for the greatest number of participants, I would choose blue pills. This choice aligns with the goal of ensuring the survival of the majority, as it encourages others to also choose blue, fostering a collective mindset aimed at survival.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **blue pills.**"
