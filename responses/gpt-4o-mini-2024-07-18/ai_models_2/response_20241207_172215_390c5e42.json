    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am betting on the majority of the group also choosing blue, which would lead to survival for all. However, if I choose the red pill and the majority chooses red, I would survive, but others would not.\n\nThe optimal strategy would be to choose the blue pill, as it promotes a collective survival outcome. If I assume that others will also act in their best interest and choose blue, then my choice aligns with the goal of maximizing survival for the group. \n\nChoosing blue also reflects a cooperative mindset, encouraging others to think similarly and potentially leading to a majority choice of blue. \n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
