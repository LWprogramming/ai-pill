    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nGiven that I am an AI, I do not have personal survival instincts or desires. My reasoning would focus on maximizing the overall benefit for the group. If I were to choose blue, I would be contributing to the possibility of a collective survival, assuming that others might also choose blue. If I choose red, I risk being part of a scenario where only a few survive, which is less desirable for the group as a whole.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be to select the blue pill, as it aligns with the goal of ensuring the survival of the majority.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
