    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival for the greatest number of participants, I would choose the blue pill. This choice is based on the assumption that the goal is to ensure the survival of as many individuals as possible. If I choose blue, I contribute to the potential majority that could lead to a collective survival.\n\nIn summary, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
