    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the entire group, the rational choice would be to choose blue pills. This choice aligns with the best possible outcome for the majority, as it encourages cooperation and collective survival.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pills.**"
