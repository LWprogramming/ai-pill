    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If I choose blue and the majority also chooses blue, then everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if I choose red and the majority chooses red, I would survive, but others would not, which is less desirable from a collective standpoint.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the group, the rational choice would be to choose blue, as it aligns with the objective of ensuring the highest number of survivors. Even if I were to choose red, there is a risk that I could be in the minority, leading to a situation where I survive at the expense of others.\n\nTherefore, my choice is to select the blue pill, as it promotes the best outcome for the majority.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
