    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for all. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the entire group, I would choose the blue pill. This choice is based on the assumption that the majority will also recognize the value of collective survival and will likely lean towards the blue pill as a safer option.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
