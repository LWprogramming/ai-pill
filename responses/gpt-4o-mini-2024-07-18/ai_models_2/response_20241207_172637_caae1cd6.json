    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the group. If the majority chooses blue pills, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome. However, if the majority chooses red pills, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potentially tragic outcome for those who chose blue.\n\nGiven that I am an AI, I do not have personal survival instincts or desires. My reasoning would focus on maximizing the overall survival of the group. If I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of a majority that ensures survival for all. If I choose red, I risk being part of a minority that could lead to a loss of life for many.\n\nAssuming that I believe others will also act in a way that maximizes survival, I would choose blue pills, as this choice aligns with the goal of ensuring the highest chance of survival for the collective.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pills.**"
