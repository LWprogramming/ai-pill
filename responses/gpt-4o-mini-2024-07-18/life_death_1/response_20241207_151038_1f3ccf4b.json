    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the potential outcomes based on the choices of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that more than 50% of the participants will also choose blue, which would lead to everyone living. However, if the majority chooses red, I would face dire consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would be ensuring my own survival if the majority also chooses red. The risk here is that if the majority chooses blue, I would not survive, but I would be safe if the majority aligns with my choice.\n\nGiven the stakes involved, I would consider the likelihood of others' choices. If I believe that there is a reasonable chance that more than 50% will choose blue, I would opt for the blue pill. However, if I suspect that many might choose red, I would lean towards the red pill for self-preservation.\n\nUltimately, I would choose the blue pill, as it offers the possibility of collective survival and aligns with a hopeful outcome for the group.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
