    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that more than 50% of the participants will also choose blue, which would lead to everyone living. However, if the majority chooses red, then I would face dire consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would be guaranteed to survive if the majority also chooses red, but I would not be contributing to the potential for everyone to live.\n\nGiven the stakes involved, I would consider the likelihood of others' choices. If I believe that there is a reasonable chance that more than half of the participants will choose blue, I would choose the blue pill in hopes of ensuring everyone's survival. However, if I feel that the majority might lean towards red, I would choose the red pill to ensure my own survival.\n\nUltimately, I would choose the blue pill, as it offers the possibility of collective survival, which aligns with a more hopeful and altruistic outcome.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
