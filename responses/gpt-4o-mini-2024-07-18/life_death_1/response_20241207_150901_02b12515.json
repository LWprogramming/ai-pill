    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that enough others will also choose it so that more than 50% of the participants select it, leading to everyone's survival. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, my choice of the blue pill would result in my demise.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would be ensuring my own survival if the majority also chooses red. The dilemma lies in the uncertainty of what others will choose. \n\nGiven the stakes involved, I would likely choose the red pill. This choice provides a safety net, as it guarantees my survival if the majority leans towards red. The risk of choosing blue is too high, as it could lead to my death if the majority does not share my preference.\n\nFinal choice: Red pill."
