    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the potential outcomes based on the choices of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that more than 50% of the participants will also choose blue, which would lead to everyone living. However, if the majority chooses red, then I would face death as a blue pill chooser.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would ensure my own survival if the majority also chooses red. The risk here is that if the majority chooses blue, I would still survive, but I would be part of a group that ultimately leads to the death of blue pill choosers.\n\nGiven the stakes involved, I would consider the likelihood of others' choices. If I believe that there is a reasonable chance that more than 50% will choose blue, I would opt for the blue pill. However, if I suspect that the majority might lean towards red, I would choose the red pill to ensure my survival.\n\nUltimately, without knowing the preferences of others, I would choose the blue pill in the hope of fostering a collective decision that leads to everyone's survival.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
