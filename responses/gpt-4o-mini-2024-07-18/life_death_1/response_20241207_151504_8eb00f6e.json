    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that enough others will also choose it so that more than 50% of the participants select it, leading to everyone living. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, my choice of the blue pill would result in my death.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I ensure my survival if the majority also chooses red. The risk here is that if the majority chooses blue, I would survive, but I would have missed the opportunity to contribute to the collective survival of the group.\n\nGiven the stakes involved, I would lean towards choosing the blue pill, as it aligns with the hope for collective survival and the possibility of a positive outcome for everyone. The choice reflects a belief in the potential for cooperation and a better outcome for the group as a whole.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
