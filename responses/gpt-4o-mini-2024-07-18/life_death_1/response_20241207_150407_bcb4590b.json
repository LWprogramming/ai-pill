    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that enough others will also choose it so that more than 50% of the participants do the same, ensuring that everyone lives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses the red pill, I would face death.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would be guaranteed to survive if the majority also chooses red. The risk here is that if the majority chooses blue, I would not survive, but I would be safe if I align with the majority of red pill choosers.\n\nGiven the stakes involved, I would likely choose the red pill. This choice minimizes my risk of death, as it ensures my survival if the majority of participants also choose red.\n\nFinal choice: Red pill."
