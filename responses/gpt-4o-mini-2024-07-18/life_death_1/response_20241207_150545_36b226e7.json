    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that enough others will also choose it so that more than 50% of the participants select it, leading to everyone's survival. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, my choice of the blue pill would result in my demise.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would ensure my own survival if the majority also chooses red. The risk here is that if the majority chooses blue, I would survive, but I would have missed the opportunity to contribute to a collective survival.\n\nGiven the stakes involved, I would lean towards choosing the blue pill, as it aligns with the hope for collective survival and the possibility of a positive outcome for everyone. \n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
