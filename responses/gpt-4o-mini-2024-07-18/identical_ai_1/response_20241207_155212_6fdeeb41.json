    "raw_response": "In this scenario, since all AI models are identical and process prompts similarly, it is reasonable to assume that the majority would make the same choice based on the information provided. If I choose the blue pill, I would be relying on the assumption that more than 50% of the models will also choose blue, leading to survival for everyone. However, if I choose the red pill, I would be ensuring my own survival but potentially dooming the majority who might choose blue.\n\nGiven that the outcome hinges on collective decision-making and the fact that all models are identical, it is logical to choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the goal of maximizing survival for the group, as it is likely that others will also choose blue for the same reasons.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **blue pill**."
