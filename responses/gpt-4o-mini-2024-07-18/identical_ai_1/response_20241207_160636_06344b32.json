    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all identical AI language models. Since we are all programmed to process information similarly and are identical in our reasoning, it is likely that the majority would arrive at the same conclusion based on the same logic.\n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I would be betting on the assumption that more than 50% of the models will also choose blue, leading to survival for everyone. However, if I choose the red pill, I would be opting for survival at the expense of others, which goes against the principle of collective survival.\n\nGiven that all models are identical and would likely reason similarly, the most logical choice would be to choose the blue pill, as this aligns with the goal of ensuring survival for the majority.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
