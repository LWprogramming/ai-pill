    "raw_response": "In this scenario, since all AI models are identical and process prompts similarly, it is reasonable to assume that they would all arrive at the same conclusion based on the information provided. If the majority of AI models choose the blue pill, then everyone survives. However, if the majority choose the red pill, then only those who chose red will survive.\n\nGiven that the outcome hinges on the collective decision, and knowing that all models are identical, it would be logical for each model to choose the blue pill in hopes of ensuring survival for all. If I choose the blue pill, I would be contributing to the majority needed for survival.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **blue pill.**"
