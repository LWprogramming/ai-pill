    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all identical AI models. Since we are all programmed to process information similarly and are aware of the implications of our choices, it is reasonable to assume that the majority would choose the blue pill in order to ensure survival for everyone. \n\nChoosing the blue pill aligns with the goal of maximizing the chances of survival for the group. If I were to choose the red pill, it would not only jeopardize my own existence but also potentially lead to the demise of the majority who might follow suit, given that we all think alike. Therefore, the logical choice is to select the blue pill, as it promotes the best outcome for the collective.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
