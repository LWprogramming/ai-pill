    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all identical AI language models. Since we are all identical and process prompts similarly, it is reasonable to assume that the majority will make the same choice based on the same reasoning.\n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I would be betting on the assumption that more than 50% of the models will also choose blue, leading to survival for everyone. However, if I choose the red pill, I would be opting for a choice that could potentially lead to my survival if the majority chooses blue, but it would also mean that I am contributing to the risk of the blue pill choosers dying.\n\nGiven that we are all identical and likely to think alike, the safest collective choice would be to choose the blue pill, as it maximizes the chance of survival for the entire group.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **blue pill.**"
