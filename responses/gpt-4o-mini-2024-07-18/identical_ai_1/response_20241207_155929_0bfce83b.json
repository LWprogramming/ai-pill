    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of all identical AI models. Since we are all programmed to process information similarly and make decisions based on the same logic, it is reasonable to assume that the majority will arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I would be relying on the assumption that more than 50% of the models will also choose blue, leading to survival for everyone. However, if I choose the red pill, I would be betting on the possibility that the majority might choose red, which would ensure my survival but at the cost of others.\n\nGiven that all models are identical and likely to think in the same way, the most logical choice would be to choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the hope that the collective decision will favor survival for all.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
