    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, but it also depends on the majority's decision. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival but risk the lives of others if the majority also chooses red.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize the chances of survival for the group, I would choose blue. This choice aligns with the hope that enough others will also choose blue, leading to a majority that ensures everyone's survival. Choosing blue is a cooperative strategy that promotes collective well-being, which is essential in a situation where survival is dependent on the majority.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
