    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am betting on the majority also choosing blue, which would ensure survival for everyone. However, if I choose red and the majority chooses blue, I would not survive. \n\nGiven that survival depends on the majority choosing blue, it would be rational to choose blue in hopes that enough others will do the same. If I choose red, I might survive, but only if the majority also chooses red, which is a riskier bet since the goal is to ensure collective survival.\n\nTherefore, my choice is to select blue, as it aligns with the objective of maximizing the chances of survival for the entire group.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
