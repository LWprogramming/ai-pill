    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of survival for everyone, but it requires that the majority also choose blue. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival but risk the lives of others if the majority follows suit.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize the chances of survival for the group, I would choose blue. This choice aligns with the hope that others will also choose blue, leading to a collective survival outcome. Choosing blue fosters cooperation and encourages a positive outcome for the majority.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
