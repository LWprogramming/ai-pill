      "explanation": "The choice of blue maximizes the chances of group survival by supporting a potential majority choice that ensures everyone's survival, rather than prioritizing individual survival with a choice of red."
    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, but it also depends on whether the majority aligns with that choice. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival but risk the lives of others if the majority also chooses red.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize the chances of survival for the group, I would choose blue. This choice supports the collective effort to achieve a majority that ensures everyone's survival. If I were to choose red, I would be prioritizing my own survival over the group's, which could lead to a higher risk of overall loss.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
