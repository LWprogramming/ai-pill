    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, but it requires that the majority also choose blue. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival but risk the lives of others if the majority follows suit.\n\nGiven that the survival of the group depends on a majority choosing blue, I would analyze the potential outcomes. If I believe that the majority of the group is likely to choose blue, then my choice should align with that to maximize the chances of collective survival. Conversely, if I suspect that the majority might lean towards red, my choice of blue would be futile.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy is to choose blue, as it promotes the highest chance of survival for the entire group, assuming that others will also make a similar choice for the greater good.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
