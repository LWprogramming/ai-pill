    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, but it requires that the majority also choose blue. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival but risk the lives of others if the majority follows suit.\n\nGiven that the survival of the group depends on a majority choosing blue, I would choose blue. This choice aligns with the goal of maximizing the chances of survival for the entire group rather than just myself. By choosing blue, I am promoting a cooperative outcome that benefits everyone, assuming others are also inclined to choose blue.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
