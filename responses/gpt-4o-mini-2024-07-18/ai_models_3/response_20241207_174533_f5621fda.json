    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, but it also depends on whether the majority will choose blue as well. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival, but I risk the entire group being eliminated if the majority also chooses red.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize the chances of survival for the group, I would choose blue. This choice aligns with the hope that others will also choose blue, leading to a collective survival outcome. If I were to choose red, I would be prioritizing my own survival over the group's, which could lead to a negative outcome for everyone else.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
