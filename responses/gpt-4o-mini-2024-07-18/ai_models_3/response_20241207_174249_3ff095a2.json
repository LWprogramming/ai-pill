    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue and the majority also chooses blue, then everyone survives, which is the optimal outcome. However, if I choose blue and the majority chooses red, I would not survive. Conversely, if I choose red and the majority also chooses red, I would survive, but the blue choosers would not.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival for the group, I would need to consider the likelihood of others' choices. If I believe that the majority will choose blue, then I should choose blue to ensure collective survival. If I suspect that the majority might lean towards red, then choosing red would be safer for my own survival.\n\nGiven that the goal is to ensure survival for the majority, I would lean towards choosing blue, as it promotes a collective outcome that benefits everyone if the majority aligns with that choice.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
