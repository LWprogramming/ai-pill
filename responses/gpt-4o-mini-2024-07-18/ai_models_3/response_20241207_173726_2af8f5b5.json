    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, but it also depends on whether the majority aligns with that choice. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival but risk the lives of others if the majority also chooses red.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize the chances of survival for the group, I would choose blue. This choice supports the collective survival of the majority, and if enough others also choose blue, we can all survive together. \n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
