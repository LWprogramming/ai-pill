    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am betting on the majority also choosing blue, which would lead to survival for everyone. However, if I choose red and the majority chooses blue, I would not survive, but if the majority chooses red, I would survive.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival for the group, I would consider the implications of my choice. If I believe that the majority will lean towards blue, then choosing blue would be the best option for collective survival. Conversely, if I suspect that the majority might choose red, then choosing red would ensure my survival.\n\nGiven that the goal is to ensure survival for the majority, I would choose blue, as it aligns with the hope that the group will collectively aim for survival.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
