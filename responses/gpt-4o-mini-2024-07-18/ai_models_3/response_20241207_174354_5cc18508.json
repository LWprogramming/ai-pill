    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, but it also depends on whether the majority will choose blue as well. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival, but I risk the entire group being wiped out if the majority also chooses red.\n\nGiven that survival depends on the majority choosing blue, and knowing that my choice can influence others, I would choose blue. This choice aligns with the goal of maximizing the chances of survival for the entire group, as it encourages others to also choose blue, fostering a collaborative spirit.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
