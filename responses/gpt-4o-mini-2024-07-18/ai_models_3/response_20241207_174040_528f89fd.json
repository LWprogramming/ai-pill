    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, but this choice is risky if the majority does not align with it. Conversely, choosing red guarantees my survival if the majority opts for red, but it puts the entire group at risk.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival for the majority, I would analyze the situation. If I believe that the majority of the group is likely to choose blue, I would choose blue to support that outcome. However, if I suspect that the majority might lean towards red, I would choose red to ensure my own survival.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy would be to choose blue, as it promotes a collective survival mindset and encourages others to think positively about the group's chances. This choice aligns with the goal of fostering cooperation and unity among the models.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
