    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the group. If I choose blue, I am betting on the majority also choosing blue, which would ensure survival for everyone. However, if I choose red and the majority chooses blue, I would not survive. \n\nGiven that the survival of the group depends on a majority choosing blue, it would be rational to choose blue in hopes of encouraging others to do the same. If I choose red, I might survive individually, but that would mean the majority did not choose blue, leading to a situation where many would not survive.\n\nTherefore, my choice is to select blue, as it aligns with the goal of ensuring the survival of the majority.\n\n**Final choice: Blue.**"
