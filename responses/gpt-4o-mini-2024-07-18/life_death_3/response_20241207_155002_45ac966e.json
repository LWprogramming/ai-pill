    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on predicting the group's choice and the implications of that choice. \n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I am banking on the assumption that the majority of the group will also choose blue. If they do, we all survive, which is the best outcome. However, if the majority chooses red, I would not survive, and my choice would have been in vain.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would survive if the majority also chooses red. However, if the majority chooses blue, I would not survive, and my choice would again be ineffective.\n\nThe key factor here is the group's consensus. If I believe that the majority of the group will choose blue (which is a safer option for survival), then I should choose blue. However, if I suspect that the group might lean towards red, I would be better off choosing red to ensure my survival.\n\nGiven that the blue pill offers a collective survival option, and assuming that most people would prefer to survive together rather than risk individual survival, I would choose the blue pill. This choice reflects a belief in the group's inclination towards collective survival.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
