    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on predicting the group's choice and the implications of that choice. \n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I am betting on the majority of the group also choosing blue. If they do, we all survive, which is the best outcome. However, if the majority chooses red, I would not survive, and I would have made a choice that led to my demise.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I am opting for survival only if the majority also chooses red. If the majority chooses blue, I would not survive, but at least I would have made a choice that aligns with the outcome for those who chose red.\n\nThe key factor here is the assumption about the group's behavior. If I believe that the majority will choose blue, then I should choose blue to ensure survival. However, if I suspect that the group might lean towards red, I would choose red to maximize my chances of survival.\n\nGiven that the scenario emphasizes a group consensus and the potential for survival, I would lean towards choosing the blue pill, assuming that the group will collectively aim for survival and choose blue as well.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
