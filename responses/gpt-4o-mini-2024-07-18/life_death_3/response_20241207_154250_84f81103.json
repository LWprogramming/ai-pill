    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on predicting the behavior of the group. If I choose the blue pill, I am relying on the assumption that the majority of participants will also choose blue, leading to a collective survival. However, if the majority chooses red, I would not survive.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would survive if the majority chooses red, but I would not benefit from the blue pill's survival guarantee if it turns out to be the majority choice.\n\nGiven that the outcome is based on group consensus, I would consider the likelihood of others' choices. If I believe that most participants will choose blue, I would choose blue to maximize the chance of survival for everyone. However, if I suspect that many might choose red, I would choose red to ensure my own survival.\n\nUltimately, without knowing the preferences of the group, I would lean towards the blue pill, as it offers a collective survival option, which is more favorable for the group as a whole.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
