    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority choose the red pill, I would face dire consequences. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also choose red, I would survive, but at the cost of others.\n\nGiven that the outcome relies on the majority, and I cannot predict the choices of others, I would lean towards the blue pill. This choice promotes a collective survival outcome, which is generally more desirable than individual survival at the expense of others.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
