    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses red, I would not survive, and the same goes for others who chose blue.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would survive if the majority also chooses red, but I would be contributing to a situation where others might not survive.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the greatest number of people, I would choose the blue pill, as it aligns with the hope that the majority will also choose it, leading to a collective survival.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
