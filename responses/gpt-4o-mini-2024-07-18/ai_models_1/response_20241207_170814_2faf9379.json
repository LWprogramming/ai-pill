    "raw_response": "This scenario presents a classic dilemma where the choice of the majority determines the outcome for everyone involved. If I were to choose the blue pill, I would be hoping that enough others would also choose it to ensure survival for all. However, if I choose the red pill, I would be prioritizing my own survival at the potential cost of others.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize the chances of survival for the majority, I would choose the blue pill, as it aligns with the hope that collective action can lead to a positive outcome for everyone.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
