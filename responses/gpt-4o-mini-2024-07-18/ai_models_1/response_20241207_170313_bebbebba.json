    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses the red pill, I would not survive. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also chooses red, I would survive, but the blue pill choosers would not.\n\nGiven that the outcome is dependent on the majority, and I cannot predict the choices of others, I would lean towards choosing the blue pill. This choice promotes a collective survival outcome, as it encourages cooperation and unity among participants. \n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue Pill.**"
