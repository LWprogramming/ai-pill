      "explanation": "The choice of blue pill maximizes survival for the group, as it ensures the survival of those who choose blue, and potentially all participants if enough others choose blue."
    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the choice between the blue pill and the red pill hinges on the collective decision of all participants. If more than 50% choose the blue pill, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome for the group. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a tragic outcome for blue pill choosers.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the largest number of people, I would choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the hope that enough others will also choose blue, ensuring collective survival.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
