    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses the red pill, I would not survive. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also chooses red, I would survive, but others would not.\n\nGiven that the outcome is dependent on the majority's choice, I would choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the hope for collective survival and encourages a positive outcome for the group. \n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
