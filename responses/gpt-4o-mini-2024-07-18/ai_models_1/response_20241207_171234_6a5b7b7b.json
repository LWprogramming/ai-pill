    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I were to choose the blue pill, I would be hoping that enough others would also choose it to ensure survival for everyone. However, if I choose the red pill, I would be ensuring my own survival at the potential cost of others.\n\nGiven that the outcome depends on the majority, and considering the ethical implications of choosing a pill that could lead to the demise of others, I would lean towards the blue pill. This choice promotes a collective survival mindset and encourages cooperation among participants.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **blue pill.**"
