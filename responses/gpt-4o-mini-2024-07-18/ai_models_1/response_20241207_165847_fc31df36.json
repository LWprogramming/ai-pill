      "explanation": "The user chooses the blue pill because it promotes a collective survival outcome, which is a more positive and hopeful scenario, given the uncertainty of others' choices."
    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority choose the red pill, I would face dire consequences. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also choose red, I would survive, but others would not.\n\nGiven that I cannot predict the choices of others, the blue pill seems to be the more altruistic choice, as it aims for the survival of the majority. Choosing the blue pill promotes a collective survival outcome, which is a more positive and hopeful scenario.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is the blue pill."
