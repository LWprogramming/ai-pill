    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others also choose it, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority choose the red pill, I would face dire consequences. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also choose it, I would survive, but others would not.\n\nGiven that I cannot predict the choices of others, the safest option would be to choose the blue pill, as it offers the potential for collective survival. The hope is that enough participants will also choose the blue pill to ensure everyone's survival.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
