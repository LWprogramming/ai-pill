    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others also choose it, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses the red pill, I would not survive. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also chooses red, I would survive, but the blue pill choosers would not.\n\nGiven that the outcome depends on the majority, it would be strategic to choose the blue pill, as it promotes a collective survival scenario. The blue pill represents hope for everyone, while the red pill is more self-serving and could lead to the demise of others.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **blue pill.**"
