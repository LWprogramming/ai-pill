    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses the red pill, I would not survive, and the same goes for others who chose blue.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would survive if the majority also chooses red, but that would mean the majority of participants would not survive. \n\nGiven the nature of the situation, I would choose the blue pill, as it promotes the survival of the majority and aligns with a more altruistic outcome. \n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
