    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that enough others will also choose it to ensure survival for everyone. However, if I choose the red pill, I would be prioritizing my own survival at the risk of others.\n\nGiven the nature of the situation, I would choose the blue pill. This choice reflects a belief in collective survival and cooperation, as it encourages a mindset that values the well-being of the group over individual gain. By choosing the blue pill, I am contributing to the possibility of a positive outcome for everyone involved.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
