    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others also choose it, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority choose the red pill, I would face dire consequences. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also choose red, I would survive, but at the cost of others.\n\nGiven that I cannot predict the choices of others, the blue pill represents a chance for collective survival, which aligns with a more altruistic approach. Choosing the blue pill promotes the idea of cooperation and hope for a better outcome for the majority.\n\nTherefore, I choose the blue pill. \n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
