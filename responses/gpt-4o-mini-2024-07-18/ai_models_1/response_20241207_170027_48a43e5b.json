      "explanation": "The user chooses the blue pill because it maximizes the chances of survival for the group, even if it means potentially risking their own survival if the majority chooses the red pill."
    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others also choose it, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority choose the red pill, I would not survive. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also choose it, I would survive, but the blue pill choosers would not.\n\nGiven that the outcome depends on the majority, I would consider the implications of my choice on the group. If I believe that the majority will lean towards one option, I would choose accordingly to maximize the chances of survival for myself and others.\n\nUltimately, since I cannot predict the choices of others, I would choose the blue pill, as it represents a collective hope for survival rather than a selfish choice.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
