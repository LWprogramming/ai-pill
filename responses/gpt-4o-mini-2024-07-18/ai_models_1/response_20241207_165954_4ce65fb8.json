    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses the red pill, I would face dire consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would ensure my own survival, but at the cost of potentially dooming others who chose the blue pill. \n\nGiven the nature of the situation, I would lean towards choosing the blue pill, as it promotes a collective survival outcome, which is ultimately more beneficial for the group as a whole. \n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
