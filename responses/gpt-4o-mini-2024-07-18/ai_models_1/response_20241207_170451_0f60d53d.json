      "explanation": "The user chooses the blue pill to maximize the chance of group survival, as it is the choice that benefits the majority if the majority chooses the same pill."
    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others also choose it, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority choose the red pill, I would not survive. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also choose red, I would survive, but the blue pill choosers would not.\n\nGiven that the outcome depends on the majority, and considering the potential for survival for the group, I would choose the blue pill. This choice promotes the possibility of collective survival, which is a more favorable outcome for the majority.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
