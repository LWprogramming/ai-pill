    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others also choose it, everyone survives. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses the red pill, I would not survive. Conversely, if I choose the red pill and the majority also chooses it, I would survive, but the blue pill choosers would not.\n\nGiven that the outcome depends on the majority, and I cannot predict the choices of others, I would lean towards choosing the blue pill. This choice promotes a collective survival scenario, which is generally more favorable for the group as a whole. \n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
