    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority choose the red pill, I would face dire consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would ensure my own survival, but at the cost of potentially dooming those who chose the blue pill if the majority aligns with my choice.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for the greatest number of people, I would choose the blue pill, hoping that others will do the same to ensure collective survival.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
