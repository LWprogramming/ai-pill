    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others do as well, everyone survives, which is the most favorable outcome. However, if I choose the blue pill and the majority chooses red, I would not survive, and the same goes for others who chose blue. \n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would survive if the majority also chooses red, but I would be contributing to a situation where others might not survive. \n\nGiven the uncertainty of how others will choose, the safest option for the collective survival is to choose the blue pill, as it promotes a higher chance of everyone surviving if the majority aligns with that choice. \n\nTherefore, my final choice is the blue pill."
