    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of all participants. If I choose the blue pill and more than 50% of others also choose it, everyone survives. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, then I would not survive. \n\nGiven that I cannot predict the choices of others, I would consider the implications of my choice. Choosing the blue pill aligns with the hope for collective survival, promoting a sense of unity and cooperation. On the other hand, choosing the red pill would be a self-serving decision, ensuring my survival at the expense of others.\n\nUltimately, I would choose the blue pill, as it represents a chance for collective survival and a belief in the potential for cooperation among participants.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
