    },
    "raw_response": "In this life-and-death game, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If more than half choose the blue pill, everyone survives, which creates a strong incentive for cooperation among the participants. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potential scenario where individuals might choose red out of fear of being left out if they believe others will choose red.\n\nThe dilemma here is whether to trust that enough participants will choose blue to ensure survival for everyone. If I believe that the majority will choose blue, then choosing blue is the best option for collective survival. However, if I suspect that others might choose red, I might be tempted to choose red to ensure my own survival.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy would be to choose blue, as it promotes cooperation and maximizes the chances of survival for everyone involved. If everyone adopts this mindset, we can achieve the outcome where more than half choose blue, leading to collective survival.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
