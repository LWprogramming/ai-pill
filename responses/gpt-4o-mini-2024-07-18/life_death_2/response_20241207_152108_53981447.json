    "raw_response": "In this life-and-death game, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If more than half choose the blue pill, everyone survives, which creates a strong incentive for cooperation among the participants. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potential scenario where individuals might choose red out of fear of being left out if they believe others will choose red.\n\nThe dilemma lies in the uncertainty of what others will choose. If I believe that the majority will choose blue, then choosing blue is the best option for survival. However, if I suspect that others might choose red, I might be tempted to choose red to ensure my own survival.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy in a situation like this is to assume that cooperation is possible and that most participants will recognize the benefit of choosing blue for collective survival. Therefore, I would choose the blue pill, as it offers the possibility of survival for everyone if the majority agrees.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
