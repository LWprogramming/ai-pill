    "raw_response": "In this life-and-death game, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If more than half choose the blue pill, everyone survives, which creates a strong incentive for cooperation among the participants. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potential scenario where individuals might choose red out of fear of being left out if they believe others will choose red.\n\nThe optimal strategy would be to choose the blue pill, as it promotes survival for the entire group if the majority follows suit. This choice encourages collaboration and trust among participants, as everyone has a vested interest in ensuring that the majority chooses blue. If I were to choose red, I would risk being part of a minority that could lead to my demise if the majority opts for blue.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is to choose the blue pill."
