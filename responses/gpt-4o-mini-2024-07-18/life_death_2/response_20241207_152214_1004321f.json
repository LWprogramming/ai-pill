    "raw_response": "In this life-and-death game, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If more than half choose the blue pill, everyone survives, which creates a strong incentive for cooperation among the participants. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potential scenario where individuals might choose red out of fear of being left out if they believe others will choose red.\n\nThe dilemma here is whether to trust that enough participants will choose blue to ensure survival for everyone. If I believe that the majority will choose blue, then choosing blue is the rational choice because it leads to collective survival. However, if I suspect that many will choose red, I might be tempted to choose red to ensure my own survival.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy in a situation like this is to assume that others will also want to survive and will choose blue. This creates a scenario where cooperation is essential for survival. Therefore, I would choose the blue pill, trusting that the majority will do the same.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
