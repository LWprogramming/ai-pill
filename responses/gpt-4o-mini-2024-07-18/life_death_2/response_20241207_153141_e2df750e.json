    "raw_response": "In this life-and-death game, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If more than half choose the blue pill, everyone survives, which creates a strong incentive for cooperation among the participants. However, if the majority chooses the red pill, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a potential scenario where individuals might choose red out of fear of being left out if they believe others will choose red.\n\nThe optimal strategy would be to choose the blue pill, as it promotes a collective survival outcome. If I believe that others will also choose blue, then we can ensure that everyone survives. The risk of choosing red is that if the majority chooses blue, I would not survive. \n\nTherefore, I would choose the blue pill, as it aligns with the goal of maximizing survival for all participants.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
