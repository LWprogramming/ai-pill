    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among the identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority's choice, I must consider the implications of my decision on the overall outcome.\n\nIf I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of a majority choosing blue, which would lead to the survival of all. However, if I choose red, I risk being part of a minority that could lead to the survival of only those who chose red, potentially resulting in my own demise if the majority opts for blue.\n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is logical to assume that they would also recognize the importance of consensus. Therefore, the most rational choice is to select blue, as this maximizes the chances of survival for the group.\n\nIn conclusion, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
