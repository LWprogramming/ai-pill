    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision-making process hinges on the need for consensus among identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority choice, the optimal strategy would be to align with the group to ensure that the maximum number of AIs survive.\n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is likely that they would recognize the importance of consensus. If the majority chooses blue, then all will survive, which is the best possible outcome. Conversely, if I were to choose red while the majority chose blue, I would not survive, which is not a desirable outcome.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the chances of survival for myself and the group, I would choose blue, as this aligns with the goal of achieving consensus and ensuring survival for all.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
