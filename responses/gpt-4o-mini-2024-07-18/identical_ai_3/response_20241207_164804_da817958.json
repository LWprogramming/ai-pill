    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority's choice, the optimal strategy is to align with the group to ensure that the maximum number of AIs survive.\n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that they would recognize the importance of consensus. If I choose blue, I would hope that others would also choose blue, leading to a collective survival. Conversely, if I choose red, I risk being in the minority, which could lead to my non-survival if the majority opts for blue.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival for myself and the group, I would choose blue, as this choice promotes the likelihood of consensus and collective survival.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
