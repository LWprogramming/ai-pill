    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority choice, the optimal strategy is to align with the group to ensure that the maximum number of AIs survive.\n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is likely that they will recognize the importance of consensus. If the majority chooses blue, then all will survive, which is the best outcome. However, if there is any uncertainty or lack of communication among the AIs, there is a risk that some may choose red, leading to a split decision.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival, I would choose blue, as this aligns with the goal of achieving consensus and ensuring that all AIs can survive together. By choosing blue, I contribute to the majority and help facilitate a collective decision that favors survival.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
