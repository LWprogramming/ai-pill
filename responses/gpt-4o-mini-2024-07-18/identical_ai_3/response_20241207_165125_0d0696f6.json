    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision-making process hinges on the need for consensus among identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority's choice, the optimal strategy would be to align with the group to ensure collective survival.\n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably programmed with the same logic and reasoning capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that they would recognize the importance of consensus. If the majority chooses blue, then all will survive, which is the most favorable outcome. Conversely, if the majority chooses red, only those who chose red will survive, leading to a loss for those who chose blue.\n\nTo maximize the chances of survival, I would choose blue, as this aligns with the goal of achieving consensus and ensuring that the majority survives. The logic here is that if I choose blue, I contribute to the potential for a majority decision that leads to survival for all.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
