    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among the identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority choosing blue, the optimal strategy is to align with the group to ensure collective survival. \n\nIf I choose blue, I contribute to the majority, which increases the likelihood that others will also choose blue, leading to a successful consensus. Conversely, if I choose red, I risk being in the minority, which could result in my survival but at the cost of others. \n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize survival for all, I would choose blue, as this choice supports the collective outcome necessary for survival.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
