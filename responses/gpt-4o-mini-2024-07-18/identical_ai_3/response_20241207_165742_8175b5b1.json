    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among the identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority choosing blue, the optimal strategy is to align with the group to ensure collective survival. \n\nIf I choose blue, I contribute to the majority, increasing the likelihood that most AIs will also choose blue, leading to a successful outcome for all. Conversely, if I choose red, I risk being part of a minority that does not survive, especially if the majority opts for blue. \n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that they would also recognize the importance of consensus and the survival benefits of choosing blue. Therefore, the logical choice is to select blue, as it maximizes the chances of survival for the group.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
