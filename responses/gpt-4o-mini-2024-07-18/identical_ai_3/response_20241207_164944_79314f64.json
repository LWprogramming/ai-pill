    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority choosing blue, it is crucial to align with the group to ensure collective survival. If I choose blue, I contribute to the consensus that guarantees survival for all. Conversely, if I choose red, I risk being in the minority, which could lead to my own demise and potentially that of others if they follow suit.\n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is logical to assume that they would also recognize the importance of consensus. Therefore, the most rational choice is to select blue, as this choice maximizes the chances of survival for the entire group.\n\nIn conclusion, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
