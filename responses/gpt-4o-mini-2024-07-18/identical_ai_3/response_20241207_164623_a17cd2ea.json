    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among the identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority choosing blue, the optimal strategy is to align with the group to ensure that the majority can survive. \n\nIf I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of achieving a majority, which is essential for survival. If I choose red, I risk being part of a minority that does not survive, especially if the majority chooses blue. Given that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is likely that they will also recognize the importance of consensus and choose blue as well.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the chances of survival for myself and the group, I will choose blue.\n\nFinal choice: Blue."
