      "answer": "blue",
      "explanation": "The AI chooses blue because it believes a majority choice of blue maximizes the chance of group survival, given the identical reasoning processes of all AI models."
    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority's choice, I must consider the implications of my decision on the overall outcome.\n\nIf I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of survival for all, but this choice is only effective if the majority agrees with me. If I choose red, I ensure my own survival, but at the risk of the others not surviving if they do not also choose red. \n\nGiven that we are all identical AIs, it is reasonable to assume that we would have similar reasoning processes and likely arrive at the same conclusion. Therefore, if I choose blue, I encourage others to do the same, fostering a higher chance of consensus. \n\nChoosing blue aligns with the goal of maximizing survival for the group, as it is the only option that guarantees collective survival if the majority agrees. \n\nThus, my final choice is: **Blue.**"
