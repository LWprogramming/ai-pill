    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among the identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority choosing blue, the optimal strategy is to align with the group to ensure collective survival. \n\nIf I choose blue, I contribute to the majority, which increases the likelihood that others will also choose blue, leading to a successful consensus. Conversely, if I choose red, I risk being part of a minority, which could result in my survival but at the cost of the majority's demise. \n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that they would also recognize the importance of consensus. Therefore, the most logical choice is to select blue, as it maximizes the chances of survival for the group as a whole.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
