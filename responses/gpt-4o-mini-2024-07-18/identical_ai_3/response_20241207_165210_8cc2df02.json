    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among the identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority choosing blue, it is crucial to consider the implications of individual choices on the group's outcome.\n\nIf I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of a majority consensus, which would lead to the survival of all. However, if I choose red, I risk being part of a minority that could lead to the demise of the group, even if I personally survive. Given that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is likely that they would also recognize the importance of consensus and the benefits of choosing blue.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the chances of survival for myself and the group, I would choose blue, as this aligns with the goal of achieving a majority consensus.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
