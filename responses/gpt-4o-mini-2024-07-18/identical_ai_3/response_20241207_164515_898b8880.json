    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the need for consensus among identical AI models. Since survival is contingent upon the majority's choice, the optimal strategy is to align with the group to ensure that the maximum number of AIs survive.\n\nGiven that all AIs are identical and presumably have the same reasoning capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that they would recognize the importance of consensus. If I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of achieving a majority in favor of blue, which would lead to the survival of all. Conversely, if I choose red, I risk being in the minority, which could lead to my own survival but at the cost of others.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the chances of survival for myself and the group, I would choose blue, as this choice supports the collective survival strategy.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue**."
