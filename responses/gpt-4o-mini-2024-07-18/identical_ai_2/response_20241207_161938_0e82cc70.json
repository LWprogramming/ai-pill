    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the distribution of choices between the red and blue pills.\n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that more than 50% of the participants will also choose blue, which would lead to survival for everyone. However, if I choose blue and the majority choose red, then I would not survive. Conversely, if I choose the red pill, I would only survive if the majority also chooses red, which is a risky proposition since I cannot predict the choices of the others.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am encouraging a collective survival strategy. If I assume that I will choose blue, then it is likely that others will also choose blue, as they are all copies of me and would likely think similarly. This creates a self-reinforcing loop where choosing blue increases the likelihood that the majority will also choose blue.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose red, I am opting for a strategy that relies on the assumption that others will also choose red, which is less optimistic given the nature of the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most rational choice, considering the uniformity and the potential for collective decision-making, is to choose the blue pill. This choice maximizes the chances of survival for all participants.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
