    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the distribution of choices between red and blue pills.\n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that more than 50% of the participants will also choose blue, which would ensure survival for everyone. However, if I choose blue and the majority choose red, then I would not survive, and neither would the majority of others who chose blue.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I am ensuring my own survival, but if the majority also choose red, then only red pill choosers will survive, which could potentially lead to a situation where I am part of a smaller group that survives.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am relying on the collective decision of all participants. If I believe that I will choose blue, then I must also believe that others will do the same, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the majority might choose blue as well.\n\nHowever, if I choose red, I am ensuring my own survival regardless of what others choose. This creates a dilemma because if everyone thinks the same way, they might all choose red, leading to a situation where only red pill choosers survive.\n\nUltimately, the decision hinges on the assumption of collective behavior. If I believe that the majority will choose blue, I should choose blue. If I believe that the fear of dying will lead everyone to choose red, then I should choose red.\n\nConsidering the perfect uniformity and the potential for collective decision-making, I will choose the blue pill, as it offers the possibility of survival for all if the majority aligns with that choice.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
