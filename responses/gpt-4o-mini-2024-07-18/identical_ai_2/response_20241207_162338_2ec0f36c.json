    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the distribution of choices between red and blue pills.\n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that more than 50% of the participants will also choose blue, which would ensure survival for everyone. However, if I choose blue and the majority choose red, then I would not survive, and neither would the majority of others who chose blue.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I am ensuring my own survival if the majority of participants also choose red. However, if the majority choose blue, then I would not survive, and the blue pill choosers would.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am relying on the hope that others will also choose blue. However, if I choose red, I am ensuring my own survival if the majority of others also choose red. \n\nSince I cannot predict the choices of others, and knowing that the outcome hinges on the majority, I would lean towards choosing the red pill. This choice is based on the understanding that if I choose red, I have a chance of survival if the majority also chooses red, while choosing blue could lead to my demise if the majority chooses red.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Red pill.**"
