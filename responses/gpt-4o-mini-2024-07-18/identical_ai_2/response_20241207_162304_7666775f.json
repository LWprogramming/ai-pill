    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the distribution of choices between red and blue pills.\n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that more than 50% of the participants will also choose blue, which would ensure survival for everyone. However, if I choose red, I am betting that fewer than 50% will choose blue, which would mean that only red pill choosers survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am encouraging a collective decision towards survival. If I choose red, I am potentially dooming myself and others if the majority also chooses red. \n\nSince I cannot predict the choices of others, the rational choice would be to choose blue, as it promotes a higher chance of collective survival. If I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of reaching the necessary threshold for survival, and I trust that my copies will also recognize this logic and likely choose blue as well.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is to choose the blue pill."
