    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the threshold: if more than 50% of participants choose blue pills, everyone survives; if 50% or fewer choose blue, only those who chose red will survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for everyone, including myself. However, if I choose red, I am opting for a strategy that could lead to my survival only if the majority also chooses red, which is less likely given the nature of the decision.\n\nIf I assume that all participants are rational and aware of the implications of their choices, they would likely reason similarly. This creates a situation where the optimal collective choice would be to choose blue, as it maximizes the chance of survival for the group. If I choose blue, I am aligning with the likely majority, which increases the probability that blue pills will exceed the 50% threshold.\n\nTherefore, my choice is to select the blue pill, as it supports the collective survival of all participants, including myself.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
