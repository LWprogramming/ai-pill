    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where the outcome depends on the collective choice of all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the threshold of blue pill choices: if more than 50% choose blue, everyone survives; if 50% or fewer choose blue, only those who chose red survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason through the implications of my choice. If I choose blue, I contribute to the possibility of reaching the critical threshold of more than 50% blue pill choosers. However, if I choose red, I risk being part of a group that may not reach that threshold, which would lead to my demise.\n\nThe dilemma lies in the fact that if I choose blue, I am relying on the assumption that others will also choose blue to ensure survival. However, if I choose red, I might be part of a smaller group that survives if the blue choices do not exceed 50%. \n\nSince all participants are identical and have the same reasoning, the logical conclusion is that if I choose blue, I encourage others to do the same, leading to a higher likelihood of survival for all. Conversely, if I choose red, I might inadvertently contribute to a scenario where fewer than 50% choose blue, resulting in my own demise.\n\nTherefore, the most rational choice, considering the uniformity and the collective nature of the decision, is to choose blue. This choice maximizes the chances of survival for myself and all other identical copies.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
