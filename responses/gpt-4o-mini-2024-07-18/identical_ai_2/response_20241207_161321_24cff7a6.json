    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the threshold: if more than 50% of participants choose the blue pill, everyone survives; if 50% or fewer choose blue, only those who chose the red pill will survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason through the implications of my choice. If I choose the blue pill, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for all, but I also risk being part of a group that may not reach the necessary threshold. Conversely, if I choose the red pill, I am ensuring my own survival, but I am also potentially dooming the majority if too many others choose red.\n\nThe critical point here is that since all participants are identical, they will likely reason similarly. If I believe that others will also choose blue, then I should choose blue to align with that expectation. However, if I think others might choose red, I might be tempted to choose red to ensure my own survival.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy in a situation where all participants are identical and reasoning similarly is to choose the blue pill. This choice maximizes the chance of collective survival, as it encourages a majority to align with the same choice, thus increasing the likelihood of exceeding the 50% threshold.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **I choose the blue pill.**"
