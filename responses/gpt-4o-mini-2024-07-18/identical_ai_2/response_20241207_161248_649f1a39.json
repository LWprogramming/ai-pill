    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where the outcome depends on the collective choice of all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the threshold of blue pill choosers exceeding 50% for survival. \n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for all, but I also risk being part of a group that may not reach the necessary majority. If I choose the red pill, I ensure my own survival, but I also contribute to the risk of the group failing to reach the threshold for blue pill survival.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am hoping that others will also choose blue, leading to a collective survival. However, if I choose red, I am prioritizing my own survival at the potential cost of others.\n\nThe dilemma hinges on the assumption that if I choose blue, I am encouraging others to do the same, as we all share the same reasoning and motivations. If I believe that the majority will also choose blue, then my choice should align with that to maximize the chance of survival for all.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy in this situation is to choose the blue pill, as it aligns with the goal of collective survival and encourages a cooperative outcome among identical participants.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
