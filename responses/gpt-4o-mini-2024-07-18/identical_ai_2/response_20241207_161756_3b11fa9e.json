    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where the outcome depends on the collective choice of all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is that if more than 50% of the participants choose blue pills, everyone survives; if 50% or fewer choose blue, only those who chose red pills will survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason through the implications of my choice:\n\n1. **If I choose blue**: I contribute to the blue pill count. If more than 50% of participants also choose blue, we all survive. However, if I choose blue and the majority chooses red, I will not survive.\n\n2. **If I choose red**: I do not contribute to the blue pill count. If the majority chooses red, I will survive, but if the majority chooses blue, I will not survive.\n\nThe critical point here is that since all participants are identical copies, my choice does not affect the overall outcome in a way that would favor one option over the other. If I choose blue, I am hoping that enough others will also choose blue to ensure survival. If I choose red, I am betting that the majority will choose red, which is a risky proposition since it could lead to a situation where I do not survive if blue pills exceed 50%.\n\nHowever, if I assume that all participants are rational and will think similarly, the logical conclusion is that everyone will recognize the need to choose blue to ensure survival. If everyone thinks this way, then the blue pill choice will likely exceed 50%.\n\nTherefore, the most rational choice, considering the uniformity and the collective reasoning of all participants, is to choose blue. This choice maximizes the chance of survival for all, as it aligns with the collective goal of ensuring that more than 50% choose blue.\n\nIn conclusion, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
