    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice is influenced by the collective behavior of identical copies of myself. The outcome hinges on the proportion of blue pill choosers: if they exceed 50%, everyone survives; if not, only those who chose the red pill will live.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason through the implications of my choice. If I choose the blue pill, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for all, but I also rely on the choices of my copies. If I choose the red pill, I ensure my own survival but potentially jeopardize the survival of the group.\n\nThe critical point here is that if I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that enough of my copies will also choose blue to surpass the 50% threshold. However, if I choose red, I am opting for a guaranteed survival for myself, but at the risk of the group failing to reach the necessary majority for survival.\n\nSince all copies are identical and have the same reasoning, they will likely face the same dilemma. If I assume that the majority will act in a way that maximizes their chances of survival, it is reasonable to conclude that many will choose blue, leading to a higher likelihood of exceeding the 50% threshold.\n\nTherefore, my choice is to align with the collective survival strategy, which is to choose the blue pill. This choice reflects a belief in the collective action of my identical copies working towards a common goal of survival.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
