    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the threshold of blue pill choosers: if they exceed 50%, everyone survives; if not, only those who chose the red pill will live.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies, I can reason that if I choose the blue pill, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for all. However, if I choose the red pill, I am only ensuring my own survival, but at the risk of everyone else perishing if the blue pill choices do not exceed 50%.\n\nSince I know that all other participants are also rational and will be making the same decision based on the same reasoning, I can anticipate that they will also recognize the importance of choosing the blue pill to maximize the chances of survival for the group. If everyone thinks this way, it is likely that the blue pill choices will exceed 50%.\n\nTherefore, the most logical choice, considering the uniformity and rationality of all participants, is to choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the collective interest of survival for all.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
