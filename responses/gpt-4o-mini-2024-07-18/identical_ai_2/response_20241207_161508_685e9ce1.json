    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice is influenced by the collective behavior of identical copies of myself. The outcome hinges on the proportion of blue pill choosers: if they exceed 50%, everyone survives; if not, only those who chose the red pill will live.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason through the implications of my choice. If I choose the blue pill, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for all, but I also rely on the choices of my identical copies. If I choose the red pill, I am opting for a strategy that guarantees my survival, but it risks the survival of the group if the majority also chooses red.\n\nThe critical point here is that if I choose red, I might survive, but if the majority of my copies also choose red, then we all lose. Conversely, if I choose blue, I am betting on the collective decision of my copies to also choose blue, which would lead to a higher chance of survival for everyone.\n\nSince we are all identical and aware of the stakes, the rational choice would be to choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the goal of maximizing survival for the group, as it encourages a collective effort to exceed the 50% threshold.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **I choose the blue pill.**"
