    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the threshold: if more than 50% of participants choose blue pills, everyone survives; if 50% or fewer choose blue, only those who chose red will survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for all. However, if I choose red, I am only ensuring my own survival, but at the risk of potentially dooming the majority if others also choose red.\n\nThe dilemma hinges on the collective decision-making process. If I assume that all copies of myself will think similarly, then the logical choice would be to choose blue, as this maximizes the chance of survival for the group. If I choose red, I might survive, but I could also be part of a larger group that collectively fails to reach the 50% threshold for blue.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to choose blue, as it aligns with the goal of maximizing survival for all participants, including myself.\n\nFinal choice: **Blue pill.**"
