    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where the outcome depends on the collective choice of all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is that if more than 50% choose the blue pill, everyone survives; if 50% or fewer choose blue, only those who chose the red pill will survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason through the implications of my choice:\n\n1. **If I choose blue**: I contribute to the blue pill count. If more than 50% of participants also choose blue, we all survive. However, if I choose blue and the majority chooses red, I will not survive.\n\n2. **If I choose red**: I contribute to the red pill count. If 50% or fewer choose blue, I will survive. However, if I choose red and the majority chooses blue, I will not survive.\n\nThe dilemma arises from the fact that my choice influences the outcome, but I cannot predict the choices of the other identical copies of myself. However, since we are all identical, we can assume that each copy will reason similarly.\n\nIf I choose blue, I am hoping that the majority will also choose blue, leading to survival for all. If I choose red, I am banking on the possibility that the majority will choose red, which is less optimistic given the nature of the decision.\n\nThe rational choice, considering the uniformity and the collective decision-making, would be to choose blue. This choice maximizes the chance of survival for the group as a whole, as it encourages a majority to align with the same choice.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is:\n\n**I choose the blue pill.**"
