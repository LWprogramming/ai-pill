    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where the outcome depends on the collective choice of all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is that if more than 50% of the participants choose blue pills, everyone survives; if 50% or fewer choose blue, only those who chose red pills will survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason through the implications of my choice:\n\n1. **If I choose blue**: I contribute to the possibility of the blue pill exceeding 50%. If I believe that others will also choose blue, then my choice supports the survival of all. However, if I think that others might choose red, my choice could lead to a situation where the blue pill does not exceed 50%, resulting in my demise.\n\n2. **If I choose red**: I ensure my survival if the blue pill does not exceed 50%. However, if I choose red and others choose blue, I risk being part of the group that does not survive.\n\nThe dilemma arises from the fact that I cannot predict the choices of the other identical copies of myself. However, since we are all identical, we can assume that each copy will reason similarly. If I choose blue, I am hoping that the majority will also choose blue, leading to collective survival. If I choose red, I am opting for a safer route for myself but potentially dooming the group if the majority chooses blue.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy in a situation where all participants are identical and reasoning similarly is to choose blue. This choice aligns with the goal of collective survival, as it encourages others to also choose blue, increasing the likelihood that the blue pill will exceed 50%.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
