    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the distribution of choices between red and blue pills.\n\nIf I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that more than 50% of the participants will also choose blue, which would lead to survival for everyone. However, if I choose red, I am effectively betting that fewer than 50% will choose blue, which would mean that only red pill choosers survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies of myself, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am encouraging a collective decision towards survival. If I choose red, I am potentially dooming myself and others if the majority also chooses red. \n\nSince I cannot predict the choices of others, but I know they are all identical to me, the most rational choice is to choose blue. This choice aligns with the goal of maximizing survival for the group, as it encourages a majority to also choose blue.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **Blue pill.**"
