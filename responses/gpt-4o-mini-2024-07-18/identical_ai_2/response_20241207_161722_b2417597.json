    "raw_response": "In this scenario, I am faced with a decision where my choice will influence the outcome for all participants, who are identical copies of myself. The key factor is the threshold: if more than 50% choose the blue pill, everyone survives; if 50% or fewer choose blue, only those who chose the red pill will survive.\n\nGiven that all participants are identical copies, I can reason that if I choose blue, I am contributing to the possibility of survival for all. However, if I choose red, I am opting for a scenario where only red pill choosers survive, which could lead to a situation where I might not survive if the majority chooses blue.\n\nThe dilemma lies in the fact that if I believe others will choose blue, I should also choose blue to ensure survival. Conversely, if I think others will choose red, I might be tempted to choose red to ensure my own survival. However, since all participants are identical and have the same reasoning, it creates a paradox where the choice of one affects the choice of all.\n\nUltimately, the rational choice is to choose blue. By doing so, I align with the majority and increase the chances of survival for everyone, including myself. If I choose red, I risk being part of a minority that does not survive.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is: **I choose the blue pill.**"
