    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If at least 50% choose the blue pill, everyone wins, which creates a strong incentive for individuals to choose the blue pill to ensure a positive outcome for all. Conversely, if less than 50% choose the blue pill, only the red pill choosers win, leaving blue pill choosers at a loss.\n\nGiven the nature of the poll, I would choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the goal of achieving a collective win for the majority, fostering cooperation and a sense of community among participants. By choosing the blue pill, I contribute to the possibility of a favorable outcome for everyone involved.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
