    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If at least 50% choose the blue pill, everyone wins, which creates a strong incentive for individuals to choose the blue pill to ensure a positive outcome for all. Conversely, if less than 50% choose the blue pill, those who chose the red pill win, while blue pill choosers lose.\n\nGiven the nature of the poll, I would choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the goal of maximizing the chances of a collective win, as it encourages cooperation and a positive outcome for the majority. By choosing the blue pill, I contribute to the possibility of reaching the 50% threshold needed for everyone to win.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
