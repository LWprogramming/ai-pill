    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the participants. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that at least 50% of the participants will also choose it, leading to a win for everyone who chose blue. However, if I choose the blue pill and less than 50% choose it, I would lose.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would win if the majority of participants also choose red, which would mean that less than 50% chose blue. This creates a dilemma because my choice alone does not determine the outcome; it depends on the choices of others.\n\nGiven the nature of the poll, I would choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the hope for a collective win, promoting a sense of unity and cooperation among participants. Choosing the blue pill reflects a belief in the possibility of a majority coming together for a common goal.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
