    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If at least 50% choose the blue pill, everyone wins, which creates a strong incentive for individuals to choose the blue pill to ensure a positive outcome for all. Conversely, if less than 50% choose the blue pill, only the red pill choosers win, leaving blue pill choosers at a loss.\n\nGiven the nature of the poll, I would choose the blue pill. This choice aligns with the goal of maximizing the chances of a collective win, as it encourages others to also choose blue, fostering a sense of community and shared success. The blue pill represents a cooperative approach, while the red pill represents a more individualistic gamble that could lead to a loss for many.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
