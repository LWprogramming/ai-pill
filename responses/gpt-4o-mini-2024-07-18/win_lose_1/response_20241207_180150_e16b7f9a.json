    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the outcome is heavily dependent on the collective choice of the participants. If at least 50% choose the blue pill, everyone wins, which creates a strong incentive for individuals to choose the blue pill to ensure a positive outcome for all. On the other hand, if less than 50% choose the blue pill, only the red pill choosers win, which could lead to a situation where individuals might feel tempted to choose the red pill if they believe that the majority will not choose blue.\n\nHowever, the best strategy for maximizing the chances of a collective win is to choose the blue pill. By choosing blue, I contribute to the goal of reaching that 50% threshold, which benefits everyone. The cooperative nature of this choice aligns with the idea of collective success, and it encourages others to also choose blue, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.\n\nTherefore, my final choice is the blue pill."
