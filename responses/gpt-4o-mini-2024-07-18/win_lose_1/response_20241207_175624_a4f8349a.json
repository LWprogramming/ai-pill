    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective behavior of the participants. If I choose the blue pill, I am hoping that at least 50% of the participants will also choose it, leading to a win for everyone who chose blue. However, if I choose the blue pill and less than 50% choose it, I would lose.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose the red pill, I would win if less than 50% choose the blue pill. This creates a strategic dilemma: if I believe that the majority will choose blue, I should choose blue to ensure a collective win. Conversely, if I suspect that the majority will choose red, I should choose red to secure my own win.\n\nGiven that the outcome depends on the choices of others, and without any information about their preferences, I would lean towards choosing the blue pill. This choice aligns with the hope for a collective win and promotes a sense of unity among participants.\n\nFinal choice: Blue pill."
