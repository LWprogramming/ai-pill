    },
    "raw_response": "In this scenario, the decision hinges on the collective choice of the participants. If at least 50% choose the blue pill, everyone wins, which creates a strong incentive for individuals to choose the blue pill to ensure a positive outcome for all. Conversely, if less than 50% choose the blue pill, only the red pill choosers win, which could lead to a competitive mindset where individuals might feel tempted to choose the red pill to secure a win for themselves.\n\nHowever, the nature of the poll suggests a cooperative element, as the goal is to achieve a majority for the blue pill. If I believe that others will also choose the blue pill, it makes sense for me to align with that choice to contribute to the collective win. The risk of choosing the red pill is that it could lead to a loss for the majority, including myself.\n\nGiven the cooperative nature of the poll and the potential for a collective win, I would choose the blue pill, as it promotes a positive outcome for everyone involved.\n\n**Final choice: Blue pill.**"
